PREFACE
T   HE following collection of Kutenai tales embraces a series of
texts collected by the late Alexander F. Chamberlain in 1891,
and another one collected by me in the summer of 1914.
The texts collected by Dr. Chamberlain were told by two menPaul, who, according to information received in 1914, lived near St.
Eugene Mission, and who had spent some time among the Blackfeet;
and Michel, who belonged to the same region. The name of the narrator of the Lower Kutenai tales is given in "The International
Congress of Anthropology" (Chicago, 1894) as Angi McLaughlin.
The texts recorded by Chamberlain are brief. It should be remembered that these were recorded on the first field expedition ever
undertaken by Dr. Chamberlain, and that it requires a considerable
amount of practice to record long tales. This accounts to a great
extent for the fragmentary character of his notes.
Among the texts collected by me, one was told by Pierre Andrew,
a man about 33 years of age, who has a good command of English.
He is not able, however, to interpret with any considerable degree
of accuracy the grammatical forms of Kutenai, so that his own
translation is always a rather free rendering of the Indian sentences.
Two tales were told by Pierre Nuria, an older man, who, however,
spoke so rapidly that the tales had to be redictated by Pierre Andrew,
who served as interpreter. Three other talcs were told in the same
way by Mission Joe, a man about 60 years old, whose dictation was
repeated by Felix Andrew, a young man who speaks English very
well, but whose ability to interpret the Indian texts word by word
was even less than that of Pierre Andrew. One tale was told by
Felix Andrew himself and was recorded by Mr. Robert T. Aitken.
The rest of the stories were told by Barnaby, a man about 60 years
of age, who, after very short practice, learned to speak slowly and
distinctly, and whose dictation was perfectly satisfactory. All these
tales were recorded without translation; and the translation was
made later on, in part with the assistance of Pierre Andrew, in part
with that of Felix Andrew.    All my informants were Upper
Kutenai, and the revision of Chamberlain's tales was also made by
Upper Kutenai; so that the dialectic forms of the Lower Kutenai
have probably disappeared.
It is interesting to note that Barnaby refused to tell the Mosquito
story (p. 25), because, as he said, it was proper for children, not for
adults.
I wish to express my sincere thanks for much kindly assistance
rendered to me in the course of my work by Rev. F. E. Lambot,
O. M. I., and the Sisters in charge of the Government School of St.
Eugene.

DESCRIPTION OF SOUNDS
e, i represent a sound which is by. origin probably a
somewhat open i. In contact with velars and
palatals, it inclines toward the sound of e. When
long, the sound is always slightly diphthongized.
o, u represent a u with very slight rounding of lips.
In contact with velars, it inclines toward the
sound of o. When long, the sound is always
slightly diphthongized.
(aC),, u open vowels, often followed by long consonants.
v open short, about as German i in Hiitte. The pronunciation of this vowel differs very much among
individuals. Some pronounce a clear t; others a
u. All admit that both these extreme forms are
correct.
1 Only in Coyote's pronunciation.

a,, u vocalic resonance of consonants.
a, e, i, u short weak vowels, very slightly voiced.
E very weak vowel of indeterminate timber, lips,
palate, and tongue almost in rest position, larynx
not raised.
aa, ei, ii, ou diphthongized vowels, ending with a decided glottal stricture, so as to be set off from the following consonants, without, however, forming a
complete glottal stop.
p, t, ts, k, ku, q  strongly aspirated surd stops (kU labialized, q velar).
ts is pronounced by many individuals as tc; but
careful speakers, particularly old men, pronounced a clear ts. When followed by w or y,
the stops lose some of the strength of their
aspiration.  Terminal k is somewhat palatalized,
except when it follows a u.
p, t!, ts!,. k!, q! very strong glottalized consonants (fortis). ts! has
in its continuant part a pure s character.
s as in English.
x  velar spirant.
I voiceless 1.
dl voiced affricative, only in the word kulidlus
(" butterfly").
m, n  often strongly sonant, with sonancy beginning suddenly before complete labial or lingual closure.
glottal stop.
aspiration. All surd stops are strongly aspirated,
but the aspiration has been indicated only in
words beginning with aa'.
The primary accent is always on the penultima, the weak vowels,
a, i, u, not being counted.

wife looked at him. At once he cut off her nose. At once Dog ran
out howling. Dog re-entered. He threw ashes on her, but her nose
was not restored. Moose took ashes. He put them on her nose
and it was whole again. He said to the two children: "Bring a
root." They two went out. They brought it in. He took it. He
threw it into the fire. He took it out of the fire. It turned into
guts. He rolled them in the fire and gave them to (Coyote). Moose
said to him: "Eat." Moose started back. Enough.

struck him with his bow stave. The Wolf ate that game. He ate

thought he would break them up. He was told by (a bird): " Don't

40. MANITOU PERFORMANCE
Some one was tied up. Louis was sitting behind the blanket. His
manitou spoke when he was thrown back. His manitou spoke
when he would roll himself about.
41. MEDICINE PERFORMANCE
The drum is beaten, and somebody does medicine work. They
take many things. They save (the patient).
42. GAMBLING
In gambling many things are lost-horses, blankets, shirts, bows,
knives, money-everything is lost.
43. GAMES
Children play, dancing hand in hand in a circle, swinging their
hands. Other games are dancing about squatting, and playing
blind-man's buff. Toys are made. Some child is caught: if it is a
boy, a snake is given to him for a bow; if it is a girl, a snake is
given to her for a digging-stick.
44. HUNTING ON THE PLAINS
Across the mountains they went, out on the prairie, but they were
afraid of the Piegans. They sang, traveling around there. They
were afraid that the Piegans would steal their horses. They did
that always when they went on the prairie. They came back when
they finished rounding up the buffaloes. Then they stopped.

'Oh, something must have happened, and I myself might almost have

"Now, why did you run away." —"I was eating branches, the wind
was blowing, the snow fell from the trees, and a branch broke off the
tree; it almost fell on me. Then it made me run away. That is
what I meant when I said,'I am running away.'" Then theylaughed

[Nos. 46 and 47. Told by Pierre Numa and Pierre Andrew]
46. FROG AND CHIPMUNK1
Frog was living in a tent, and her granddaughter was Chipmunk.
Chipmunk I went around. She looked for everything. Frog said to
her granddaughter: "Don't go that way." Then Chipmunk went
about again. She thought: I "What did she mean me to do, that I
should not walk there?"  Chipmunk II thought: "I will go that way 5
where she told me not I to go." Then she went. She saw Owl. I
Owl spoke, and said: "I shall bite the child." I (Chipmunk) was
picking partridge berries and rose hips. On account of what had been
said she did not move. Owl spoke, and said: "Your mother says we
shall go 11 home."- "My mother died long ago."  He said: "Your 10
sister (says) I we shall go home." She said: "My sister died long
ago." I He said: "Your mother's sister (says) we shall go home."- I
"My mother's sister died long ago." He said to her: "Your father's
sister says we shall go home."- I "My father's sister died long ago.""Your younger sister ] says we shall go home."-"My younger 15
sister died long ago."- Chipmunk spoke, [ and said to Owl: "You
look terrible; you have big eyes. I Cover your eyes with your hands,
then I'll go along."  Owl covered his eyes with his hands. I When
Owl had covered his eyes with his hands, Chipmunk began | to run.
Owl tried to klill her, and scratched II Chipmunk. Owl looked at his 20
claws, and he licked off the blood that was on his claws. I Then she
got back to her grandmother. She said: I "Grandmother, Owl is
pursuing me." She said to her granddaughter: "There is no place
where I can hide you." | Frog took her granddaughter and put her
in a birch-bark basket. Chipmunk made a noise inside 1| that 25
basket. Frog thought she would hold her in her mouth, but it was
very bad. I Then she took her out of her mouth. There was soup of |
rotten bones. She dipped her into it. Then Frog just sat down. |
Owl came in. Owl spoke, and said to Frog:2 "Did you see the
child? " Frog said: " I did not look around. 11 I did not see her." Owl 30
said: "There are her tracks." I Frog said: "I did not see the child."
Owl said: "Is there no water? I am thirsty." I Frog said: "There
is no water." Then Owl said: "Is there no soup?"   Frog said:
"There is no fluid. This is I rotten bone."  Owl said: "I'll drink 35
of it."  Frog said: I "Leave some fluid for me." Then Owl began to
drink. I He saw the child was inside. Owl said: I "She is inside; you
told me a lie; you said that you had not seen her." Frog spoke, I
and said to him: "You shall preserve her bones." Then 11 Owl bit 40
the child. Then he ate her. After he had eaten, | he went out of
the house. Then Frog began to cry because her granddaughter was

and put them together. She carried them to the water. Then she
threw them into the water. Frog went back to her tent. She went
in 11 and sat down. After a while, Chipmunk ran back into the tent 1 45
the same way as she had been before. | She was glad. She jumped
at her. She embraced her. She said to her: I "I am glad, grandmother, that we meet again." I That is the end.
47. COYOTE AND BUFFALO1
Coyote went along. He found the head of a Buffalo Bull. He
picked it up I and threw it away. Then he went on. He went along
and I went about and came back the same way, there where he had
gone before. He went along I and came back to the place where the
head was, at the same place where the |1 head of the Bull was. It 5
happened three times when he went along. Then he said to it:
"Why, I went here before, this way where you are lying, and you
lie in the same place again." j He took a stone and smashed it. He
took it and I scattered the pieces about. Then he started. He went
and found a flat stone. I He threw his blanket over it. Then he lay
down. While he was lying down, 1| he cried. He said while crying: 1 10
"Their mother Dog, 2 Q!uta/ptsek and Mis'qulo'/wom
ha ha ho'ya; weswis wis!" |
He heard noise of running. He arose. He looked around, | and
there was nothing. "Oh, I thought I heard running; but it is
nothing, 1] because there are many passers-by who did it."  He 15
lay down again. | After a little while he heard noise of running
again. He raised I his head quickly. He saw a Bull approaching, I
that ran after him. He jumped up quickly. I He started to run. He
was pursued. He was out of breath and was tired. 1{ Then Coyote 20
spoke, and said: "Somebody shall help me." I He was told: "It is
good, nephew, come to me." I He disappeared inside. Then the Bull
arrived. He knew that (Coyote) I was in there. The Bull butted it.
It was a stump. He split it in two. I Coyote ran away quickly. He
started again. When he had gone a little ways, 11 he was out of breath 25
again, and he spoke again, saying: "How far are you, I manitou? I
amin danger."  He was told: "Nephew, come tome, | come in." He
saw it was a stone, and then I he disappeared in it. The Bull arrived.
He butted it and I broke the stone in two. Coyote jumped uip quickly 11
and jumped away. He went along, and after a short distance I he 30
was out of breath again. Again he spoke: " I am already in danger." I
Somebody spoke to him, and he was told: "Come, come to me."
That was a small bush. He disappeared inside. The Bull arrived
and butted it. He missed it. He could not hit |I the little bush with 35
his horns. The Bull could just not get it. Coyote said: J "Stop, stop

wife." II Coyote looked at her. He thought: "This younger one 1 70
must have strong bones. The big one must be good. I I think I
will take her. She must be good." He said to the Bull: "I I take
this one." They said to each other: "We will part now." | They
shook hands and said good-by. Then they parted. 11
Coyote and his wife went off. He saw a mountain in front. 1 75
He said to his wife: "That place looks like a valley. Go there. I
I shall go roundabout." The Buffalo Cow went on. I Coyote went
another way. He went quickly. He came back quickly I to the
place where his wife was going. He arrived and sat down. II After a 80

Then I will eat her. I am hungry." The | Cow arrived. As she
walked along, Coyote shot her. I He killed her. There she lay. A
little ways off there was a flat stone. I He sat down on the flat stone.
He sat there and II began to cry. He cried for his wife whom he had 85
killed.
After a little while | many wolves arrived. They ate at once
what he had killed. Coyote thought he would stand up, but he stuck
(to the stone). I He tried to get up, but he couldn't get off. I Then
the wolves ate the Cow. They ate it all. II Nothing was left. Coyote 90
just got up. He arose. His backside came off from the stone.
Coyote said: "Let me stick on, I let me stick on!"
He went there, and there were only bones. I He thought: "Well,
I will break the bones." He piled I the bones together, and he was
about to break them. He was told: "Nephew, 11 I do not allow you 95
to break bones." He said: "That is so." I He looked, and there was
Badger. He was told: "I'll break the bones." I He was told: "You
shall hold my tail." I Then he held (Badger's) tail. He was told:
"Don't hold on too tightly, I you will badger my tail." Ie did so.
He did not hold the tail tightly. II Badger Woman took the bladder 100
and put I the marrow into it. It was a big, round piece of marrow.
Coyote was told: I "I shall eat that much," and (Badger) passed her
hands close to her mouth. j Coyote also said: "I'll eat that much."
Then Badger ran away quickly, carrying the marrow. Coyote
pursued her. 1I He ran after her. Badger was eating all the time. 105
When she had finished, I she threw back the bladder. Coyote was
told: I "I suppose you want that." Badger went off. Coyote took
his bladder. He licked it. It was greasy. I
Coyote was standing there. There were only the remains of broken
bones. 1 He thought: "I will pile them together. I will pound them 110
to pieces."  He | sat down. Coyote began to pound. He was told:
"Nephew, I won't I allow you to break bones." He saw two women.
They were i two birds.1 He was told: "We will pound it. I Meanwhile go and get something that you may 11 use for a spoon. When 115
you see that there is a fire, i come back." Coyote started. He took
a root out of the ground, I pounded it, and dried it. Coyote staid
there. I Then he saw a large firc. He went back, and J when he go6
back,/ nothing was left. He looked up the tree, 1I and there was one 120
of the birds. The other one was on another trce. I One carried the
grease; the other one, I the chopped bone. He had nothing to eat of
the game he had killed. Enough. l

48. THE ANIMALS AND THE SUN
There was a town. A chief gave his commands. He said: "Who I
will be the Sun?" Then they began to talk about it. One of them
was | told: "You shall be the Sun." After this one had been told
that he was to be the Sun, all heard about what 1I was to be done. 5
Those, who were told to be the Sun went. I The name (of this one)
was Raven. Then he started. I It became dark. On the following
morning they watched for him to come up. I He came up. It was
not bright enoughwhen | he came up. The day was always blackishll
It was always like evening. The Sun came back. I They said: "This 10
way is bad. It is always | blackish." They said that he could not
be it. I Another one was looked for. Chicken Hawk was sent. I It
grew dark. Then Chicken Hawk started. On the following morning he went [1 up. When he went up higher, the world looked yellow. 1 15
It was always like that. He went down. I In the evening the Sun
came back. They said: "You can not be it. I It looks like bad
weather."  They assembled and talked it over again. Coyote said: I
"I will be it."  They said: "Well."  Coyote was about II to start. 20
Coyote started. At night I they slept. On the following morning
Coyote went up. I When he went up, it began to be hot. It was
fairly warm, and 1 then it was noon and the people cooked food. The
Sun spoke, and I said: "Will there be any left for me?" It was
heard 1] what. he said, and they left food for him. Even when they 25
went into I the shade, it was warm. The children began to cry, I for
the Sun burned them. They went to the water, and they thought [
it would be good, but the water was hot. It was the same I when
the Sun went down. It became warmer and warmer until 11 sunset. 30
When it was dark, they felt well. They had almost I been burned to
death. Coyote came back. He was told: "You can not be it; I you
are bad. You were too hot." I
There was one woman with two children. They said: "We will I
go there where they are playing Sun." II The two went. They ar- 35
rived there, and they were told: "Why do you come?" I They said:
"We heard that they play Sun." I They were told': "It is good. You
shall go." Then he, I the elder one, started. They slept. The next
morning I he went up. In the morning it was coolish. II He went high 40
up, and they always felt comfortable. I At noon it became warm, and
when they were in the shade I it felt comfortable. They went swimming, and they felt well. [ They felt cool. Then he came down. Then
The narrator said that many others were tried, but he did not remember their names, See pp. 48,116.

they felt comfortable, I because the Sun was setting. At night the l
youth came back, and all thought that he should be I the Sun. The 45
youth was told: "You shall be the Sun." I In the evening he came
back, because it was given to him I to be the Sun. The other youth,
the younger one, I staid there. He was told: "You shall go in I| the 50
evening; you shall be the Moon." Then he went off. I It had not been
dark long before the Moon went up. I It was always light throughout
the night. I On the following morning he came back. He was told:
"Your elder brother shall be I the Sun during the day. You shall be l
the Moon." These two became the heavenly orbs [Suns]. These 1 55
two youths were thought to be good, I and they were glad. Then it
was decided. |
Coyote was angry. He thought: "I will kill the Sun." I Then he
made his bow, and he also had two arrows. 11 Then he went in the 60
night to the place where the Sun was to come up. I He staid there.
On the following morning he took a good seat. I He lay on his stomach. Then he aimed at the right place. l The Sun rose. He aimed
well I and was about to shoot. Then his arrow was burned. 11 It burned 65
quickly, and he threw it away. Then everything was on fire. He
ran away. I There was fire on each side where he was going along. I
He ran and went into the water. I He was almost burned. He saw
a trail and I lay down on it. The fire arrived, and it turned backll
because there was no grass on the trail. I He was saved. The people 70
saw that the land was burning. | Some one said: "Why is this?'"
They said: "Coyote is not here; it must be he who has done it."
Coyote said: I "'Later generations of people will do this. II When there 75
is a fire, they will lie down on a trail., I Then they will be saved."
Then the people said: I "Don't do what Coyote has done. I Later
generations shall not | play Sun." Some one said: "Now you know

"Let us go and play with them!" ~ They started. II Coyote was their  5
chief. Woodpecker, Flicker, Hawk, Chicken Hawk, Duck, and
Bluejay, seven of them, went. | They reached the town. They were
told: "What do you want?" l (Coyote) said: "We come to play."
He was told they would play I at diving. Coyote was told: "Who II
will play?"  Hesaid: "Duck shall be the one." The I people of the 10
town said: "Our (player) shall be Beaver.", I Some one said:
"Ready!" Then they went to the shore. I Coyote went there. There
on shore was a canoe. I He pulled out the calking, and he said to the
little Duck: "I have taken the calking out of this canoe. 1| When you
dive, come up here! You shall | stick your nose up through the hole."
Then the two dived, | and many people watched. Whoever | should
float dead on the water, he was to lose. Beaver | never lost. Therefore he was selected when any one came to play with them. [[ He 20
was never beaten. Then they were watched.  The sun was going
down. Coyote had said to the little Duck: I "When (you hear)
shouting, then Beaver comes up out of the water. I Then you may
come up, too." It was almost | sunset. Then at the place where
Beaver had dived 1| bubbles came up; and not long after the bubbles 25
had come up, | he floated on top of the water. Then there was a
noise. They were glad I because he had won. Then the little Duck
dived back. I He knew that he would win. Then he came up. |
Chief Coyote said: "Now we will go on. 1| We have won over you." 30
They came to another town, i and they were told: "What do you
want?"   (Coyote) said: "We will play." | He was told: "What will
you play?"  He said: "Whatever you I like." - He was told: "We
will play boxing." I He was told: "Whoever is knocked down, he
will lose." I1 Coyote said to his children: "Who will play?" | Flicker 35
said: "I'll be it." He was told: "No; you will be knocked down." I
He said he wanted to be the one. There was I an expert boxer. He
could not speak. i Flicker was the younger brother. 1| The most expert 40
one in the town was Kneecap. Then they met. | They went against
each other, those who were to fight. Flicker was struck a hard blow, |
and at once he was thrown upward. He was always rolling about, {
and lost his senses. He was thrown back, I and he was struck again
from below. He was knocked back still farther. Hawk was sitting
there, [1 and saw that his younger brother had almost been killed.  45
Then he went out of his own body.' He went up to Kneecap I and
struck him hard. He gave him a hard knock | when he struck him.
I-He went up to him and struck him again. Then he | knocked a piece
1 This was explained that his supernatural power went out of his own body to attack the enemy.

off from him. Then he knew that he could kill him, and he was given 11
back to Flicker. It was he again.' Then I Flicker fought him down, 50
and that one was killed. | Thus Coyote won again in a bad manner. |
He said: "Now we will go."  They went, I and arrived at a town.
He was told: "What do you want?" 1I Coyote said: "We will 55
play." He was told I somebody would play eating. Much food was
prepared. I Coyote and his children were told: "Who will play?" |
Bluejay said: 'I'll be it."  Then they went into I the tent. Bluejay sat down and 1] began to talk of his great-great-grandfathers, who 60
lived long ago, and i those before them. Then he ate and talked.
There was a great pile I of food. He had not been talking very
long before he had eaten it all. He was still hungry. | Then they
won. (Coyote) said: "Enough!" They went along.
At 'once they began to quarrel. Coyote said 1} he would take 65
them through swamps. Coyote was told: "You I may go there
alone, for you like them, therefore you say so." Little Duck said: J
"We will go through little lakes."  He was told: I "You may go
alone. You like them, therefore you say so." | Flicker said he
would take them through young dry trees. 11 He was told: "You 70
may go there alone. You like them, therefore I you say so."
Woodpecker said he would take them   through t thickly wooded
places. He was told: "You may go there alone. I You like them,
therefore you say so." Hawk said he would I take them through
places with scattered trees. Thus they quarreled. 1| They became 75
angry at one another and separated. That is the end. I
50. THE WAR ON THE SKY2
There was a town. There was Muskrat's brother's widow. He
thought J he would marry her. Then she refused him. He was
angry and shot her. I The arrow was of a different kind. He made
it in a different way, what he used for shooting her. I Then he ran
away. He said to his grandmother: " — - (?)" 3 Then II his face 5
was torn up. Then the dead woman was discovered. I The arrow
was not known. They sent for Frog, who (was in the habit of going)
all I over the world. They wanted to know where that I arrow came
from. Then she (Frog) went into the house where | the arrow was
kept. She herself knew that. it was her grandson's arrow. 1[ She did 10
not know what to do, because it was her grandson, and she did not
want to tell on him. I She spat into her hands and nodded. I They
thought there must be a country in the sky, and that there must
be a lake. | Some one said they would go on the warpath. One of
them I was able to shoot fqr. He shot upward, and a noise was
heard 11 as the point hit. Then another one shot and I hit the notch 15
of the (first) arrow. Then all of them shot, I but they did not reach
1 That is to say, Hawk's power had entered Flicker, and now left him again.
2 For another version see p. 87.
3 My interpreters did not understand this sentence. The word so'q!une'ito' is derived from aa'ka'q!ne
(" face").

down. When Raven put his nose there, I then it reached the ground.
When they were going to start, [ Wolverene said: "Wait for me.
It will take me two days 11 to put away my things. It will take me 20
two days." He was still l putting away his things when they
started. Then Wolverene became angry I because he was left.
When they had gone up, he took hold of (the arrows) and I tore them
down entirely. They all dropped down. Then the women became
angry I at him because they were left alone in the town. They pursued Wolverene, 11 and he was about to be killed. They pursued 25
Wolverene, and he was out of breath. I He took up his sinews and
cut himself to pieces. He changed himself I into a squirrel. He put
it under the belt which was I around his waist. Then he went back
somewhere, because he could do no more, | being tired. He went
around, and some one said: "Here || is Wolverene." He said: "I am 30
not he; I am called I He-who-wants-to-act-differently-from-others'
and-who-does-not-care-for-whatever -may-be-done. I I am shooting
squirrels."
Now, Muskrat, who had gone up, I started and made a large lake. I
He built tents for himself, many tents, although he was only one. ||
There was a village. Then the people reached the village. They 1 35
began to make war. They tore up the tents. When the first one
was broken up, a left-handed man was seen to come out. I They
shot (?) him in the stomach. Then, when they tore up another |
tent, he came out again in the same clothing that he had worn
before. II His tent was broken, and that left-handed man | was shot (?). 40
Then they began to speak, and some one said: "Maybe I he is always
the same one." Then it came to be known that he was always the
same one; namely, Muskrat. I Some one said: "Stop shooting himshooting at his stomach." I Then they left him.
Then they started back |I to the place where they had come from. 45
There was nothing. (The arrow chain) was broken down. I The
manitous did not know how to get down. I The war chief said: "We
will wait t at the drinking-place of Thunderbird." They waited for
the Thunderbird and I killed him. Then his feathers were taken off. [1
Then they gave them to every one to be their feathers. i There were 50
two friends, the Bats; and there were I two friends, Golden Eagle and
Young Golden Eagle-two of them. Then the good i feathers were
laid aside. Some one said: "Don't touch I them, they are for the
friends." The Bat friends 1I nudged each other. They thought they 55
were meant. Then I all the feathers were given out. Then the I two
chief friends were given feathers. They went back to I the place

Then I the Bats flew down, spreading out their blankets. I They used
them for wings. The Flying Squirrel pulled out | his skin and used
it for wings. He used it to fly with. 11 All the fish threw themselves 65
down. The Sucker was the \ only one who was broken to pieces.
All tried to restore him, but it could not be done. All the manitous |
touched him; and when some one tried to fix him, he put I pieces of
his own flesh on. They thought it would cure him, but he was not
cured. I There was Sucker's brother's widow. He always wanted
her to touch him. [1 Then she also went to him, and | his brother's 70
widow touched him. Then he I was well again.
Those warriors who were left behind | did not know how to get back.
They said: "Being warriors, we shall finally reach the earth (?)."
They were about to start for the place where heaven and earth meet. )1
They were about to go to war. These were the brothers I Wood- 75
pecker. They started back to go down to the place I where they had
come down. Then they reached the ground. When they came
back, | at Nelson they met the manitous, I and were told: "When you
go back, you will see a fish. Don't 1] touch it, wherever you may stay 80
over night." They were also told: I "Don't stay over night where
there are thick trees." Then | they bewitched one another. Woodpecker and his I brothers were going along; and while they were going
along, they found a charr drifted ashore. I Woodpecker thought he
would kill it. He said to Flicker: "Many things 1| have been done. 85
Have you a great name, and is it right that you make trouble ' (?)" I
Flicker was just about to touch the charr when it I went back into the
water, and he did not touch it. It happened that the water was
rolling in toward the shore, I and without his knowing it he was
swallowed I by the Water Monster. Then the other one started and
went along. 1I He came to a place where there were thick woods. 90
It was getting evening, I and he camped there over night. Then,
while he was asleep, I a little toad went under his blanket. Woodpecker thought I what he had been told did not mean anything, and
he did not mind what was said to him. I Then he went to sleep. The
little toad stuck on his body. 11 It was always like that. At one time 95
the younger brother I Woodpecker died. The Water Monster had
killed him. A law had been made I for Woodpecker (?).
He said: "We will go around the mountains." I Then they went
hunting. When the food was done, they started to come back I to the
lake. They came up and sat down. II Then he saw Nalmu'qtse.1 100
Nalmu'qtse was a large I man. He was going about giving names I to
the country. He followed this Kutenai River. He saw Woodpecker I
and his brothers, and said to them: "0 nephews! give me some
food." I Woodpecker hated his uncle Nalmu'qtse. II He was angry at 105
him, and took a whetstone, threw it into the fire until I it was red-hot.
He took the heart of a Mountain Goat and put I the whetstone into

"He'he he'he he'!"   He said: I "My brothers are angry with
me. I have escaped." | The name of that place was Little
Heart.l Then he came down the lake and I saw a Water Bird2 and
a Water Ousel. He spoke to them     and gave them I food. He
said to them: "You will go along each side of the lake. You will
say, 1| 'You are invited, you are invited, you are invited, I you are 115
invited, you are invited."' They were told: "If you don't come
to me, your lake will be dried up." I Then those who went on each
side of the lake said so. I Wherever there is a bay here, there they
danced. I He said to them: "All the fish shall come ashore to the
tent of I Woodpecker to eat (his food)."  Then, when he came back, | 120
all the fish came ashore, there at the tent. Woodpecker I was told:
"The chief has not come back yet. He will | tell you something."
They waited for him, and the fish3 arrived. [ When he arrived, he
was given a pipe. Then he, It Woodpecker, and his brothers, smoked. 125
They were all men. ] Only one of them was a woman; namely, their
younger sister (a bird with yellow breast and gray feathers). I Then
the sister herself saw the fish smoking I and moving his eyebrows
while he was smoking. I He said: "Where is our grandson "  Then(I
he moved his eyebrows in this direction. He moved them a little 130
ways. I Then he told them that (the grandson) was on this lake. I
He finished telling the news. Then he was told: "Now [ I am glad.
Now go!" Then the fish went back into the water quickly. I Then
he had some food. 1I The fish is like that. He is red on each side; 1 135
that is the meat, the-food (that he was given).

in the water. He intended to kick him i on the head, but the blow
glanced off from the head. It He missed it. Then (the monster) was 145

tomahawk pipe. When he caught up to it, I he looked at it, and said:
"Ahei! there is no other man like me. I shall be the first I to strike
the Water Monster."  He hit its head, I killed it, and it was cut to
pieces. [1 Then it was cut open. Then Flicker and Duck I and his wife 180
came out. Duck and I Flicker were white on each side. They washed
themselves. Then I Duck and Flicker and Duck's wives, I those who
had been swallowed by the Water Monster in their canoe, said I[ that 185
while they had been in the belly of the Water Monster I they had
made a fire with their canoe. They had been told: "Don't I make a
big fire; it might melt the fat (of the monster)."  Then Flicker I was
worn down to his present size. |
Then the ribs on one side of the monster were cut off. They were
thrown away II down the river. The one side of the ribs is now a cliff 190
below. I Then the other side was thrown away, there i where it was
being cut up. Therefore the cliff is named Standing Rib. I Then its
body was cut up and was I scattered about where there are people. 11

51. THE GIANT
There was a town. One day I two men/brothers, went out hunting.
The two brothers were going along. The elder one I saw a bighorn
sheep and shot it. He carried it down. Then toward I sunset he
became hungry. He thought: "I'll make a fire [1 and roast a piece of
meat. When I have finished eating, I will hang up the meat and
dry it." | Then he threw a piece of the bighorn-sheep meat into the
fire. When it was cooked, he ate it. I It was without taste. He
thought: "I'll cut a piece of my own body and I'll roast it in the
fire." I Then he cut a piece off of himself and threw it into the fire.
When it was done, I he ate it. It tasted good. He cut off another
piece and threw it into the fire and ate it. [1 After two days he had  10
eaten himself entirely. Only his bones were left. I Then his younger
brother went home, and the following morning he thought: "I will
go and I look for my elder brother." He started and went along to
the place where they had been hunting. I He arrived there and heard
a sound. He stood still I and listened. There was a hill. He heard
the sound 11 from that direction. He arrived there and went up. A  15
little ways off I there was a fire. He went there, and he heard his
elder brother making that noise. He was I saying: "Oh, I love my
brother, and it will take me two days to eat him!" I Then he arrived
there. The elder brother saw him and ran after him. I He struck him
with his intestines, and threw him down with them and killed him.  20
Those at home said they ought to look for the brothers. I The elder
one's wife started looking for them. The woman i went along. She
heard a sound somewhere. She went there, and she saw him from a
little ways off I sitting down. He was saying: "Oh, I love I my son!
It will take me two days to eat him."  The woman went along behind
a hill. II Something told her: "Sticksharp stones on your clothing. I
He will strike you with his intestines, and the stones will cut them. I
Then he will not be able to catch you." Then she stuck I stones on
her clothing. She went nearer. He struck her, I and his intestines

Wolverene had torn the trail, and they could not go down. | They
shot the thunderbird, and they were given its feathers and | down.
There were none for Woodpecker and his brothers. II Then they got 20

they came down and returned I to their country. When they saw

giving names to the land."  Nalmu'qtse said: I "Oh, I am glad!"
He was told: "Open your mouth." Woodpecker I put a stone into

Then Nalmu'qtse opened his mouth, 11 and Woodpecker threw the 35
heart into it. Woodpecker had manitou I power, and Nalmu'qtse
was the same way. I When Woodpecker reached him, Nalmu'qtse
knew that his nephew was evilly disposed I toward him. He nodded
to the heart, and it I fell down on one side. Nalmu'qtse said: "~, II
you will be named Little Heart." Even though somebody was 40
angry with him, I he gave names to places, because he was walking
about this world I in order to give names. I
(Woodpecker) was told: "Don't sleep where there is a I thick

is to be called Ear." 1] Then the chief fell and died. Nalmu'qtse 55
fell and was nearly dead, and nevertheless I he named one more
place. I
Now I have told you how Nalmu'qtse, our great-great-grandfather
generations back, died. I
53. YA.UKUE'iKA'M
Well,I'll tell about Chief Ya.ukue'ika'm, | the Kutenai, long ago.
(a) THE BIRTH OF YA.UKUE'KKA'M
Frog was living in a tent. There was her granddaughter, named
Young Doe. I Young Doe went picking berries. Frog said to 1] her 5
granddaughter: "Don't go and drink at the water hole in the ice. I
When you come into the house, drink here." For a few days I her
granddaughter did so. One day Young Doe was picking berries
again. | She came to be thirsty, and thought: " Let me drink I from the
water hole." She drank. Then a man put out his hand II to pull her 10
into the water. She thought'she would die. She saw, however, there
was I a tent where she had been taken into the water. I The man took
her and married her. I The name of this man was White Stone. She
staid there. j Then her husband went hunting. In the spring of the
year she had a child. 1| Then the child was called Ya.ukuefika'm. His 15
father and I his mother called him Ya.uk"e'ika'm. That man knew
that his son would be | a chief, therefore he gave him this name. |
Then White Stone had an elder brother. That man was bad. I He
was quick-tempered. He was named Gray Stone. Then among
these I1 brothers, Gray Stone, the one, was always angry; I the other, 20
the younger one, was not angry. He had a strong I mind. Then
Ya.ukue'ika'm was like stones striking together (?). I Gray Stone
made noise inside. Then when he went around, I Ya.ukue'ika'm was
told by his mother: 1I "Your father's brother, Gray Stone, does not 25
feel good when you are here. Now'you are large, go to your I greatgrandmother's tent. Her name is Frog. She loves all I children
and all big people who are her grandsons I and her granddaughters.
Frog is my grandmother. When you get there and she sees you, I she
will say to you: 'My grandchild, let me see you and love you.' II You 30
will always play there." ]
Then Ya.ukue'ika'm started for the tent. He arrived and I looked
in. He saw an old woman I sitting there in the rear with her back

years old. Then he was going to throw something, to throw II sleep 3
into the old woman. Frog was sitting there, and did not sleep. I She
became sleepy and lay down. She slept. I Then Ya.ukue'ika'm entered. He began to play.  I-e knew; for his mother had told him,
how she was. TIe knew the belongings I of his mother. Then he
played with them in the evening and went 11 back tohis mother. When
he arrived, his mother said to him: "Why do you I come back? You
ought to stay with your grandmother:."  Ya.ukue'ikam said: I "Iwas
afraid; that old woman looks terrible." I His parents laughed at him.
They said to him: "Later you will love her. I All children like that
old woman." Frog was asleep. II She arose and saw that the inside 45
of her tent looked strange. I She looked, and she found out a child
had been there. She said: " Oh, my grandchild, my grandchild has
arrived, and therefore I slept."
In the morning Ya.ukue'ika'm started again, and Frog saw I the
evidence of a child having been there. "Nobody knows whether 11
it is my grandson or my granddaughter."  Therefore she made a
bow and I a little basket. She put them down. She thought: "I
was asleep ] when he came in. If I should go to sleep again, when I
he comes back I'll know what it is." That was the reason why I she
made the two kinds of toys. Frog was 11 sleepy. She lay down and 55
slept. Again I Ya.ukue'ika'm came in. Therefore she went to sleep
again. I Ya.ukue'ika'm entered. He looked, and there was the little
bow and the little basket. 1 He ran for the little bow. She had also
made two figures of deer (of grass). I Then he took the little bow and
went out. He shot [[ at the figure of the deer. When it was almost 60
evening, I the figure of the deer was torn to pieces. He carried it in
again and went back. Frog arose. I She looked at what she had
made, and the little basket was hanging there. I The little bow was
lying there.  It was broken.  Then she knew that her grandchild was | a boy. She said: "O grandson, grandson! He must
have come while II I was sound asleep." On the following morning 65
she thought: "Even if I do 1 feel sleepy, I'll not go to sleep."
She made a figure of a deer (of grass) and put it down. I She.lay
down. She thought: "Let me lie down again." There was I Ya.ukue'ika'm. He looked in, and the old woman was asleep. I He
thought: "She is sleeping." Then he entered. He took [I the little 70
bow and the figure of the deer. Then he carried I them out. He was
about to play with them. Frog saw him. His clothing was | bright
red. The child was good-looking. She ran for him I and took him.
She said to him: "0 grandchild, grandchild!" I He said to her: "Let
me go!" Then Ya.ukue'ika'm went out and ] shot at the figure. 75

(b) YA.UKUE'IKA'M OBTAINS ARROW WOOD
Now, Ya.ukue'ika'm was growing up. He thought: [ "What shall
I do?" Long ago there were no service berries in this world. I There
was just one place where there were some. Because it was not long I
since Ya.ukue'ika'm was born, therefore he did not know this world.
He said: 11 "Hya! I wish there might be some arrow wood! Then 85
I might make arrows." Long ago I arrows were made of serviceberry shoots. There were none. Therefore | Ya.ukue'ika'm said so.
Frog said: "0 grandchild, grandchild! | far away there is arrow
wood. | Those who go to get arrow wood die there. Grizzly Bear
watches the arrow wood. 1| Whoever goes to get it, is bitten by 90
Grizzly Bear."  Then I Ya.ukue'ika'm started. He arrived where
two Cranes I made a noise when they saw anybody. Then Grizzly
Bear knew I that somebody was coming. When the Cranes saw
Ya.ukue'ika m, they wanted I to make noise. He said to them: "Oh,
don't tell Grizzly Bear! t1 When I pass again, then you may tell him." 95
He started again, and saw two | Marmots. They intended to whistle.
He said to them: "Don't i talk now! Later on, when I pass again,
you may talk." I He started again, and saw two Beavers. They intended to make a noise. | He said to them: "Don't make a noise!"
Then Ya.ukue'ika'm saw II plenty of service berries. He took much 100
arrow wood. I He threw it all over the country. He said: ' "By andby
there will be many people in this world. It would not be right if service berries were I only in one place in the world." Then there were I
service berries in every country. It was he, Ya.ukue'ika'm, who
did it. II
Then he put the arrow wood on his back. He started back, and 105
came to Beaver. He said to him: "Now tell Grizzly Bear."
Then (Beaver) made a anoise. Grizzly Bear heard Beaver. He said:
"Ya, y!-what does it mean? I hear noise going back."  After a
little while ] the Marmots also made noise, and Grizzly Bear said so
again. After a little while II the Cranes made a noise, and Grizzly 110
Bear spoke again. He told his children: I "Go out (to see) what has
been done!"  His children went out, and I they saw there were no
more service-berry bushes. They said: I "There are no more serviceberry bushes."  Then Grizzly Bear. became angry. He sang.
He took his coat. The coat of II Grizzly Bear is a skin. He put 115
it on and became a grizzly bear. He went out and jumped near his
children. The two (children) jumped back. I He said to them: "How
do I look? " Hewastold: "You look terrible."  Then Grizzly Bear |
went out. He looked at the tracks, and he saw I that it was

killed. Then I Grizzly Bear was changed into a grizzly bear. He
was not a person | when he started from the tent. Then he changed
into a grizzly bear, [1 and he remained a grizzly bear when Gray Stone 175
had killed him. | He was no longer a man. I
Chief Ya.ukue'ika'm stood there. He thought: "My uncle Gray
Stone is skillful. I He killed the grizzly bear. If it had not been for
Gray I Stone, Grizzly Bear would have killed me." Ya.ukue'ika'm
thought: 11 "Well, let me see my grandmother Frog. What may she 180
do I if I go back to her tent "  He said: "Well, cut off the head of I
the grizzly bear. I'll drag it to my grandmother Frog. What I may
she do for me?" Then the head of the grizzly bear and its paws I
were cut off. Ya.ukue'ika'm dragged it along. He entered his
grandmother's l tent. He said to her: "Grandmother, GrizzlyBear is 185
pursuing me."  Frog said: | "0 grandson, grandson! what can I do
for you? I What am I? Why do you come back to me? I You should
go back to your parents. Your uncle I Gray Stone is very skillful.
He ought to kill Grizzly Bear."  Frog arose. I1 She sang(?). She 190
took red paint alid painted her legs. I She took a sharp flat stone
and put it up by the doorway. I She took her hammer and stood
ready to strike Grizzly Bear. Frog did not I see the rawhide strap
with which Ya.ukue'ika'm was dragging the head. I (The head) was
lying in the doorway. When Ya.ukue'ika'm 11 saw his grandmother 195
ready (to strike), he pulled the strap. Then the grizzly-bear head
dropped down under the door. I Grizzly Bear put his nose into the
tent. Then Frog saw I Grizzly Bear put in his head where the flat
stone lay. I Almost the whole head of Grizzly Bear came in. Frog
thought: II "The head might jump at my grandson," | and she struck 200
the grizzly-bear head. | When Frog was striking it, Ya.ukue'ika'm
pulled hard at I the strap and pulled the grizzly-bear head in. Just
then Frog ] struck it and hit her flat stone. She broke 11 the flat stone. 205
Then Frog saw that her grandson I was fooling her. She cried because I her grandson had done some damage. Therefore she cried. ]

(C) YA. KUEtIKA'M OBTAINS FEATHERS
Then Ya.ukue'ika'm staid there. He said: "If there were | feathers, I should feather my arrow."  Frog said: "There are I1 feathers 210
far off. There is a lake, and there are some ducks way out on the
lake. | They stay there and do not come ashore. Those who go to
get feathers I just pick them up along the shore. I The feathers are
there. They come off from the ducks." Then Ya.uk"e'ika m I started.
When he arrived there, he carried ear ornaments. He discovered
that his grandmother 1| had spoken the truth. Way out on the lake 215
were some ducks. It was a large (body of) water. Then Ya.ukue'ika'm I went to the shore and sat down. He did not know how to get
the ducks. I He saw one there swimming not far away; | but many
ducks were making a noise with their mouths, playing. II One Duck 220
saw the man I walking along the shore. Then (Ya'ukue'ika'm) sat
down. He was bright red. The Duck had never seen I a man.
They always went to get feathers on shore. I Therefore the Duck did
not know (what) a man (was). I Ya.ukue'ika'm said to the one Duck:
"Come ashore for a while." II Duck thought: "He might kill me," and 225
did not come ashore. I Ya.ukue'ika m said: "Don't be afraid of me, I
won't kill I you. I will make you (look) nice. You willbehandsome." I
Then Duck came ashore. It saw that the youth looked nice. [ He said
to Duck: I'll take your feathers. When I have taken them, II I'll pay 230
you for them."  Then Duck thought: "This youth I is well dressed.

Then Ya.ukue'ika'm I plucked out the feathers of the Duck. I He
took them all off. Then Ya.ukue'ika'm took the ear ornament
and stuck it on I[ where he had plucked off the feathers. He said: 235
"Now I go, swim away!" Then Duck swam away there, [ far out
to sea. (Ya.ukue'ika'm) said (to Duck): " Well, move your wings!"
Then | the Duck stretched out its wings and moved them. I Its
feathers looked pretty. Then many ducks saw the man sitting
there away off. 1| That one floating about alone started to swiln 240
ashore. I They knew that -the man must have called it ashore. I
When they saw it coming back, farther out to sea, they saw it
spreading its wings.  Oh, they were pretty, ha!    When (the
Duck) began to swim back, Ya.ukue'ika'm said to it: ] "Go back
there to your relatives! They shall come ashore. I'll make them all
(look) in the same way 11 in which I made you."  Then, when (the 2 5
diver') came back I to its relatives after it had been finished by
Ya.ukue'ika'm, I it was called Diver. When it arrived back where the
many ducks were, I they saw how its feathers were. I It had pretty
new ones. Diver said: [1 "Look at me, how I am!"  They said to 250
him: "You look pretty on account of the things that are on I your
wings." Ite was told: "Go on, move your wings!" | Then Diver

"You may fly to a nice place there back from the shore. There are I

to him. When he had taken him across, Ya.ukue'ika'm was told:ll
"Now go on, climb up the mountain! Farther along it hangs. You I 285
shall bring it." Then Ya.ukue'ika-m knew that (Bighorn) intended
to kill him. I He went up and went on some distance. Then he
went up again. He looked at the I old man, who was going back in

You will take I the sinew."  Then Ya.ukue'ika'm started and came
to the tent of Mouse at A,'qo'la'ka's.1 He entered. Mouse said:
"What do you want?"    He knew it was Ya.ukue'ika-m. 1I He had 355
heard that there was a youth named Ya.ukub'ika'm I who was to be
chief.  When Mouse spoke to him, "What | do you want?" he
whispered. Ya.ukue'ika-m said: "I have come." I When Ya.ukue'ika'm spoke, he spoke loud. Mouse said: I "Don't speak loud. Bull
Moose might break our tent." I1 Ya.ukue'ika'm said: "Give me I your 360
bow."  He gave it to him. He looked at it. I It was bad. (Mouse's)
younger brother carried meat. He said to the one who brought the
meat: | "Give me your bow."  He gave it to him. He looked at it.
It was almost I good. Then Ya.ukue'ika'm went out. He shot II the 365
Bull Moose, shot it again, and killed it. He said to them: | "Take
the meat and the skin. You shall split I this skin. I shall take only
one thing. I shall take the sinew." I Then Mouse and his brothers
cut it up. | Ya.ukue'ika'm went back, and arrived at his grandmother's (tent). ]1 He staid there.  Then he made an arrow. 370
Then it was all finished. I
(f) YA.UEUE'lKAM OBTAINS FLINT
He said: "If I knew where there is some flint, I should get it." I
Frog said: "0 grandson, grandson! i it is far away where the flint is.
The flint is a man. | It is a stone. When a person arrives and intends I
to take it, then the stone becomes a man. I Then it can not be taken." 375
Ya.ukue'ika'm thought: " I'l I go after that stone." Then he started,
1 This is a small hill on the south side of St. Marys River, an isolated part of the lowest terrace in the
valley of the Kootenay River. The hill is called A'qo-laa'ka's.

and arrived at | the house, and already the stone had become a man. |
When the stone saw him coming, it had changed its form, 11 and there 380
was another stone there where they get it from, I which is used to hit
(the flint). Those who pay I can take the stone. Then it is a stone I
from which they get arrow points and knives. For this reason I they
pay for it; namely, that 1| the flint may not transform itself. When 385
they do not pay, it turns into a man I who does not give his flesh.
When Ya.ukue'ika'm entered, I the stone had already turned into a
man. ' Flint thought: " Ya.ukue' kam is a chief; he will pay a great
deal." i Flint said: "What do you want?"  Ya.ukue'ikam said: |I "I 390
want flint." Flint said: | "You will pay for it. Then I'll become a
stone. I Then you may take me." Ya.ukue'ika'm sat down. I IIe
thought: "I'll fool him." Then he went out. I He went to Diorite,1
and said to him: " Flint says II you can not break him." Diorite said: 395
"Oh, I Flint lies, I am strong. I break him into big pieces'l when I
get angry. Why did he say so "    Ya.ukue'ika'm went out. I He
went back to Flint. He said to him: "Diorite I always says he will
break you into big pieces." Flint said: [1 "Oh, Diorite lies, he can not 400
break me. I When I grease my body, I am strong."  Ya.ukue'ika'm
went out again I and came to Diorite. He said to him: " Flint I says
you can not break him. He says you are lying. When he I greases
himself, then he is strong." Diorite said: 11 "Go back and tell him 405
that I'll fight with him." | Ya.ukue'ika'm went out again and said
to Flint: "Diorite says | you shall fight with him."  Then Diorite
took his knife, | and also Flint. They said; "Well, I let us fight!"
They attacked each other and struck each other. II Oh, Flint lost. 410
Big pieces of stone were coming off from him. I Then Ya.ukue',ka'Im
took the flint and diorite. | He had much because they were fighting.
Then I he took the flint and diorite and scattered them over i this
world. He said: "Let flint and ] diorite occur all over this world. 415
For a long time people will be I here in this world. It might be I difficult for them to get flint and diorite." I The friends were fighting.
They did not know that I Ya.uk"e'ika'm had scattered the stones.
When Ya.ukue'ika-m finished doing this, II he told the friends: "Now 420
stop doing this to each other. I I cheated you. You will not be I people any more when they come to get you. Now I have put an end
1 Or some other tough stone.

other. | Ya.ukue'ika'm carried the flint along, and now 1I there is 425
flint everywhere in this world. |
(g) YA.UKUE'tKA'M OBTAINS BOW WOOD
Now, there was one thing that he did not have, a bow. When
Ya.ukue'ika'm came back I to his grandmother, he said: "Let me see
where there is bow wood. I I'll get it." Frog said: "0 grandson,
grandson! I it is far away where bow wood is found, and those who try
to get it are killed." II Ya.ukue'ika'm started. He went a long ways. | 430
He went along and heard a noise. His grandmother had told him
that he would be near by when it would be like that. He went along
and heard I squirrels making a noise. That squirrel bit everybody. I
Ya.ukue'ika'm saw a tree standing on each side of the trail. 1] They 435
struck each other continually. It looked terrible. The trees killed I
every one. If they could not kill him, the squirrels I bit him. Long
ago they were of the size of grizzly bears. ] The squirrel was big and
looked terrible. Ya.ukue'ika'm took his spear, | and, when the trees
went apart, he 11 put his spear across. Then they did not move any 440
more, and I he went through. Then the squirrels were angry and
tried to bite Ya.ukue'ika'm, but the squirrel was stabbed and killed.
Then | the squirrel was dead, and from it crept a little animal, which I
climbed up the tree here. Ya.ukue'ikam said: "Oh, II you shall be 445
Squirrel. There shall be many of you. I You may continue to bite,
but you may bite only the hands of children I that play with you."
Then he chopped down I the bow wood and scattered it. He said: I
"Lct cedar grow all over this world." Therefore 11 cedar, that is 450
the bow wood of the people, grows everywhere. I Then Ya.ukue'ika.m
started back. I
(h) YA.UKtE'IKA' M GOES TO THE END OF THE WORLD
He came back to his grandmother, and he said to her: "Grandmother, how big is this I world?"  Frog said: "The world is small."
Ya.ukue'ika'm said: 1 "From what place does the sun start? " I Frog 455
said: "It is far." Ya.ukue'ika'm said: "Where I does the sun go
to?" Frog said: "It is far I where the sun goes to."  Ya.ukue'ika'm
said: "I shall I look for the place where the sun starts from, and
later on I shall look for the place where the sun goes." II
That is all I know about what Chief Ya.ukue'ika'm did I among the 460
people of ancient times. ]

Then he did so. When they were red-hot, l he took them with
sticks to where the fat was in the water. I
Ya.ukue'ika'm was going along. He looked back, and he saw there
was no I Coyote. He thought Coyote was not acting right. Ya.ukue'ika'm went back. I He came to where the fat had been hanging.
There was no 1] fat. It was steep there. He saw the I tracks of Coyote 25
going down, and also the fat I and the tracks going along with it.
Then he started down. Way below he saw I a fire. He saw Coyote,
who was there. I He went down. He saw him carrying the stones
with sticks II to the place where the fat was in the water. A piece of 30
the fat came up to the top of the water. | Coyote took a mouthful of
the fat. I When Ya.ukue'ika'm arrived, Coyote did not see him. Ya.ukue'ika m saw I his friend suffering. He said to him: I "Why did you
do that?"  Coyote was scared. II He said it tasted good. He was 35
told: "I told you I they take just one bite." Then Ya.ukue'ika.m
took | a pole. He fastened a knife to it. He speared I the fat. Then
the fat was broken up. I The fat came to the top of the water. Then
Coyote was told: |1 "Now eat all." ThenCoyote took I the fat ashore. [ 40..See p. 48.

(b) COYOTE AND THE GIANT
Then they started to where they were going. They were going
along. I Ya.ukue'ika'm said, he said to Coyote: "A child is hanging
in a cradle. | The child is crying. One does not listen to it. |1 Don't 45
listen to it!" Then they arrived there. Coyote heard I the child crying. Then, when Ya.ukue'ika'm arrived, | he went past. He did not
look at the child. When I Coyote arrived, he also did not look at the
child, and went past; I but he had not gone past far when he took pity
on the child. I1 He turned back and arrived there. He put his finger 50
into the child's mouth. I The child sucked his fingers and | found them
nice. The child did not cry. Then his hand began to go into the
mouth, | and he knew that the child was going to swallow him. | He
pulled at his arm, but could not pull it out. 11
Then Ya.ukue'ika'm knew it. He looked back, and 1 his friend 55
Coyote was not there. The child was not crying. I Ya.ukue'ika'm
turned back, and he came to the child I which was swallowing Coyote.
Ya.ukue'ika'm took | his knife and stabbed the child's head with it. l
Then the child was dead. Ya.ukue'ika'm took I Coyote's arm. 60
There was no flesh on Coyote's arm. Coyote saw | that it was no
child, but a giant. | Then the friends went on. One of them had no
flesh on his arm.
(c) COYOTE AND THE THUNDERBIRDS
The friends were going along. Coyote was told: "The way where
we II are going along you will hear birds. Do I not listen to them." 65
Then they went along. Then I they heard the birds. They made a
noise. I Ya.ukue'ika'm went past, and also Coyote. He did not I listen
to the birds that made a noise. 11 Coyote said: "I am not listening to 70
you, but lako'lsak, ko'lsak, I ko'lsak!"  When Coyote said so, the
friends, without knowing it, | were already raised from the ground.
They were going up. I Then they arrived there where the birds were.
They had gone into I their nest. These were two young thunderbirds.
Both 1] friends went in, Coyote and Ya.ukue'ika'm. Then I they 75
staid there. Ya.ukue'ika'm said to the children: "Where is the
sun when your parents come back?"  One of them said: I "It is
almost evening when the one comes back, and- it is evening I when
the other comes back. They look terrible." It was 11 on rocks on 80
one side of the mountain, and Ya.ukue'ika'm said | to his friend:
"Listen to me! If you donot I listen to me, we shall die. You know I

glad, now my children have something to eat."' 11 He knew that 85
Ya.ukue'ika'm was chief. I Therefore he said that he was glad that
his children killed him (?). Now it began to rain. I The Thunderbird
made a noise. Then they saw the Thunderbird flying home. I Thunderbird said: "I am glad, now I I have something to eat for my children." (I forgot something. II Coyote was told that when the Thun- 90
derbird would say he was glad, I he would say, "Who is tired from
walking? I shall take the marrow out of his leg." I Coyote was told:
"When the Thunderbird says this to us, I get up and say, 'I don't
get tired, I I don't get tired; my younger brother always gets tired
because [I he is shaped badly."') Then Coyote sat down again. 1 95
Ya.ukue'ika'm was told: "Stretch your leg this way, I will pull out |
the marrow with my mouth." Then Ya.ukue'ika'm stretched out his
leg. Then | Thunderbird put his mouth there, and it was just as if
Ya.ukue'ika'm had no more marrow. I Then (Ya.ukue'ika-m) threw
his spear and stabbed 1] the Thunderbird with it in the nape of the 100
neck. He killed the Thunderbird, who I broke his nest while he was
falling down. Then | he was there. The two children were told:
'When your father comes, I and if he says, 'Why is our nest broken?' | tell him: 'That happened when they came up."' II The two 105
manitous were sitting down in the place that was broken. It was
not I long before it began to rain again, and the Thunderbird made a
noise again. I Then the Thunderbird flew back; and this one I spoke
in the same way as the other one had spoken. The Thunderbird said:
"Who I is tired from walking? I shall pull out the marrow from his
leg." Coyote arose 11 and said this. He said the same as before. He 110
danced and said: I "I don't get tired from walking, I don't get tired
from walking; my younger brother always gets tired I because he is
badly shaped." Then Coyote sat down again. I Thunderbird said:
"Stretch your leg this way, I will pull the marrow out of it." I Ya.ukue'ika'm stretched out his leg 1( the way he had done before, and 115
his marrow was as it had been before. I He threw his spear at him
and killed him. I
Then he said to the two children: "Now fly down with us." I One
of the children said: "Sit down on my back.'' I Then Ya.ukue'ika'm
sat on the back of the one. II His friend was told: "You shall make 120
a noise." Then I the young Thunderbird flew away. He flew upward. I
Coyote was looking on. He flew way up. Then I Coyote shouted,

Coyote." Coyote sat on the bird's back. I He sat on the back of the
other one, and he also flew up. I Then he shouted again, and he
flew back down to I the ground. The two friends, Coyote (and
Ya.ukue'ika m) were glad. Hesaid to the (Thunderbird): I "Don'tbe
angry with the people. II You may scare whoever lies about you." 130
That was Ya.ukue'ika'm's prayer. I Then there were no more thunderbirds. That is the reason I why they do not kill any one now. The
thunderbirds only make a noise. |
(d) THE ANIMALS MAKE THE SUN
The friends went along. The way tie friends Coyote (and
Ya.ukue'ika'm) were going along | they heard that the sun was being
made. Then i! they started. He was to be the sun. Perhaps the 135
one who was to be taken | would be the sun. Therefore the two went
on together. I Some one was to be the sun. The one who was good
was to be taken. I He was to be the sun. Then they arrived at that
town. I They were told: "To-morrow you will start." I1 They meant 140
Ya.ukue'ika'm. Then night came. Early in the morning Ya.ukue'ika'm started, I They waited for him, and he went up. I The sun was
red. Because Ya.ukue'ika'm I always' painted his clothing with
ochre, I therefore his shadow was bright red. It was not hot. It was
good. Whenllhe came back, he was told: "You are good. There is 145
only one thing, everything I is entirely red. Your red paint has done
it." I Ya.ukue'ika'm could not do it because he was I bright red. I
Then Coyote was told: "To-morrow you shall go." Then they 150
slept. Early.ia, the morning Coyote started. Then I he went on.
At once it was hot. 1 At noon it was very hot. Shade was made, but I
it was always hot. The children were put into the water of the
river, | but the. water burned them. The water was entirely hot.
Even I cold water was hot. Then the Sun always talked. I When 155
Coyote saw a child crying, | he said: "Put it into cold water;" and
when he saw I the people eating, he said: "You will give me something to eat, something must be left for me. I I shall eat in the
evening when I return." Then the Sunlltold everything that was 160

stole I a woman, also the man and, the woman catch each other."
Then I it was evening; and when the sun had almost gone down, it
remained I always hot. At night Coyote came back. Then he went

He said it should be left for him. I

(e) THE LYNX CHILDREN
The two young Lynxes (Short Faces) arrived. There was the
tent of Lynx.. His wife had two children, twins. Lynx started I to
look for soup. His wife was to drink it in order to get Imilk. He 170
arrived where the salmon were. | Lynx looked for them. One day
he got one. | He ate it all. He staid there another night. On the
following day he looked again, I and he got one more. He was there
a long time, but he kept nothing I because he ate it at once. Then
the two children grew up. 11 One of them said to his mother: "Who 175
is our father?" His mother said: I "Your father went that way."
He saidtohis mother: "What I is he looking for?" His mother said:
"He is looking for salmon for you, I but he did not come back." The
two children listened, I and went together where somebody was to be
the sun. It The children said: "We will go, we shall be the sun." 1 180
Then they started. They went. They saw a lake. | There was an
old man. He was looking for fish. I They knew it was their father.
He was poor. They said to him: I "What are you here for?" Lynx
said, he said to them: 11 "Long ago I had two children. Then I 185
started I to look for soup, which my wife was to drink to get milk
for my children. I can not kill them." He was told by the youths: I
"Well, say that again." Lynx said: "I I raise the water with you."
Then the two youths saw the water rising. 1| Lynx said: "Let the 190
water go down with you." And | the water went down. Then the,
two youths saw I many salmon. They took sticks and I killed the
salmon. They saw their father I going after them. He went after
one to kill it, and they laughed at him. II Lynx looked at the pile of 195
salmon. He was told: | "Now you try!" Then he knew it. He
ran after them. | He was glad. He knew they were his children.
He was told: " We are going I where they are playing sun. You I go
back to your wife." 11
(d) THE ANIMALS MAKE THE SUN (CONTINUED)
Then the two youths started, and they arrived at the town. I They 200
were told by the chief: "To-morrow you I will go." One night passed,
and early he started. I Then he went up. It was almost cool. Then I
he came up, and it was almost warm. When [1 it was almost noon, it 205
was warm. Then at noon I it was warm. Shade was made. Then

they swam in the water, and they stopped perspiring. I The water
was always cool. The Sun did not talk. Then, I when he went down,
it was not warm. Then II he went down, and it was not hot. After 210
some time I he went down. Some time passed, and it became dark. I
Then the youth came back. The chief said: i "The Sun is good.
He shall be the Sun." The other one was told: | "You shall go at
night." He was to be 1l the Moon. Then it was dark. Then the 215
other I young Lynx started. He went up, and I the Moon shone
brightly. Almost everything could be seen by the Moon. They
could almost recognize things at a distance. | Then the Moon was
good, and II he also was taken. He was to be the Moon. 1   220
Early the next day. Coyote started. I He was angry at the Sun,
because the chief had rejected him. I He arrived at the place where
the Sun rises. He staid there, I aiming at the Sun. Then, I| when he 225
saw the Sun coming up, he was angry. Then (the Sun) | was angry
with him, and made his arrow burn. (Coyote) saw that I his arrow
was burning. Then hethrew away his arrow and his I bow. Then he
ran, after he had thrown away I his bow and his arrow. Then the
ground began to burn, and 1] the fire pursued him. He saw that | the 230
fire had almost caught up with him. He saw there was a trail.
Then he lay down quickly, and his blanket was burned over, but
he could not burn, and the fire went by him. | Therefore the trails do
not burn. I] Then the two young Lynxes were Sun and Moon.  235
It is all finished.
55. THE PEOPLE TRY TO KILL YA.UKVE'IKA'M
Now I will talk more about Ya.ukue'ika'm, how he | was killed and
came to life again.
There was a village, and there was the tent of Ya.ukue'ika'm. I At
one time the people became angry at him. He was now II a full-grown  5
man, and he knew that he would be killed. He thought: I "Don't let
me be afraid. Don't let me be angry at my people, only I at those
bad things that I have killed." The people were afraid of him, I and
did not know what to do with him. Then they killed him I and threw
him into the river. The people were glad 1I because they had killed  10
Ya.ukue'ika'm. Then they all broke camp. I Crane was told: "You
shall drag a young tree. I You shall cover our tracks." Then they
started. It was I winter time, and they made tracks on the snow.

A few days after they had broken camp I in winter, Ya.ukueika'm was
down below. The people did not know 11 that Ya.ukue'ika'm's mother 15
had gone I down into the water, and that Ya.ukue'ika'm was born
there I and had come from the water. Now, when they had thrown
Ya.ukue'ika-m I into the water in winter, then the fish ate him I because he was dead. Therefore the fish did so. II They ate up his body. 20
Ya.ukue'ika'm knew at once that the fish I were eating of his feet,
and he kicked them. He said: I "Why are you eating me?"  The
fish said to him: "We are I not angry at you. Why do you kick
us? | We are restoring you." Then Ya.ukue'ika-m knew himself.'l]
The fishes said to him: "Go ashore! You shall go. I The people 25
went in that direction. I Don't think that it is a long time since they
broke camp. I Crane dragged a young tree along to cover their tracks.
They thought you would not know which way they went." I Then
Ya.ukue'ika'm went ashore to the village site. He looked at it II and 30
saw which way they had gone. He started. After about i three or
four days he saw a village site. He saw that there was [ some fire
left at the village site. He knew that they had started from there
early in the morning. I He started and went along. He heard
Crane I singing. He reached him, and said to him: "What are you
doing II with that young tree?" Crane said: "Several days ago 1 35
Ya.ukue'ika'm was killed and was thrown into the water. We are
afraid he may I come back to life, and he will go the way we are
going and will kill everybody. I. have been told to drag along this
young tree, so that, if he should come back to life, I he may not recognize the trail."  Then (Ya.ukue'ika'm) knocked 11 Crane down. 40
Ya.ukue'ika'm went on, and reached I Crane's wife. Then he knocked
her down. He started, and saw l somebody going along. He
reached that person, and saw that it was his sister-in-law. I She went
along crying. She said: " My brother-in-law Ya.ukue'ika.m used to
take me along this way. | The people were afraid of him, 11 and the 45
other day they killed him. Now I am poor. I am hungry, I for the
people are not afraid of him. My husband's brother is no more."
She carried her child on her back. Her child's name was Duck.2 I
Ya.ukue'ika'm poked the child with a stick. The child looked at
him I and saw him; and Duck said to his mother: 11 "Uncle Ya.u- 50
kue'ika'm is here." Then the mother of Duck turned around and
looked. I There was a tree, and Ya.ukue'ika'm had gone behind it |
when his sister-in-law looked at him. There was nothing there.
The woman thought I her child had told a lie. She struck him.
She said to him: 'Oh, I don't you know how I feel because my
brother-in-law has been killed? II The people make us suffer." I She 55
was crying while she was naming Ya.ukue'ika'm; I and Ya.ukue'ika'm


I Pro~bably 11 came to his senses."

she struck her child. Then Ya.ukue'ikam said: "Why do you I
do that to the child? You hurt him."  The mother of Duck turned
round quickly, 11 and it was true what her son had said. Ya.ukue'ika'm  60
had arrived I and had come back to life. Then the woman said: I
"I am glad that you arrived. We are poor. I When your brother
kills game, they take it away from him. When I go along | and put
up my tent, it is taken away from me; 11 and when I go to another 65
place and make my tent and finish it, I it is taken away again. Then
it is dark and I have no tent. I When the hunters come back and
bring much deer meat, I your brother alone has not any, for they
take away all I the deer he kills. Then in the evening we are hungry.
When the chief defecates, 11 they call Duck, and he must rub him 1 70
with his head."  Ya.ukue'ika'm said: "Now | go on! When you
get there, make your tent, [ and if any one wants to take the place
that you have arranged, strike him; l and put flint on the head of
Duck." 11 He said to him: "When the chief calls you, and when he 75
tells you I to rub him with your head, then hit him with your
head." | Then Duck and his mother started. Ya.ukue'ika'm
started | and went along where the snow was trodden down. He saw
his younger brother. I He said to him: "Don't you kill any game?"
He said: "I have killed some, II but it was taken away from me; and  80
I went hunting again, but it is like that always. I If I kill game, it is
taken away from me. Even if it is much, it is all taken- away from
me. I Then in the evening, when I get home, I and my wife and
child are hungry. I I am poor." Then Ya.ukue'ika'm said to his
brother: I "Go on; lookfor deer! and 11 if you kill it and some one tries 85
to take it away from you, go after him I and strike him, and say:
'Don'ttakeit. If you try I to take it, I'llshoot you.'" Ya.ukue'ika-m
said: "I shall not shoot deer. Later on in the morning I I'll shoot
some."  Then the man started and killed 11 a deer. Somebody went 90
up to him and intended to take it. He went after him I and struck
him with a stick. He said to him: "If I you try to take what I
kill, I'll kill you. | You have killed my elder brother; now I'll get
angry with you." I Then they were afraid of what he had done.
When Duck and his mother arrived, I1 she cleaned a place for their 95
tent; and when she had finished, i she got firewood. Then they
wanted to take it away from her, I but she went after them and
struck them with her ax. | (In former times the people had for their
axes I stone hammers and antler wedges, which they used for splitting trees.) II The people were afraid, for she had not done before 100

(a) COYOTE MISSES THE DEER
Coyote lived in a tent. His wife was Dog. It was winter
time. Dog and her children with her went out I for fuel. There was
a stump. She chopped it down. For a long time I a deer used to
have a hole there in the stump that Dog chopped down. 1| The deer  5
was hit when it fell. There was its hole. It was broken. I The deer
jumped out quickly. There was snow on the ground, and Dog followed the deer. I She caught up with it and caught it by the tail. She
said to her children: I| "Go and get your parent. He shall shoot it." L
The two children started to run. One was named II Misqolo'wum;  10
the other one was named Q!ota'ptsek!. Misqolo'wum I was a boy;
Q!ota'ptsek! was a girl. They arrived | at their tent and spoke to
their.father. They said: "Mother says you should come I and take
the deer." Coyote ran out quickly. I He split a little tree 1 and he
broke in two a bush.2 [I He went in again and pulled off quickly his  15
hair band. | He went there. He spilled rose hips, which were all the
food that they had. I He ate them. Then he made a bow, and he
quickly made two arrows I out of the bush.2 Then he started. He
got there, and his wife stood there | holding the tail. He had snowshoes on his feet. There was much snow where 1| his wife was hold-  2(

said to her: "Now let go!" Then Dog I let go of the deer. The
deer was running in the deep snow. Coyote shot. I Just then (the

what she thought was bloody, but it was a stump. I She stopped and
almost fainted from hunger. It was so because she was hungry. I She
saw that it was a pile of shrews. I Coyote looked at her. Then Coyote rubbed [it on] his hair. I[ She was told: "Why are you standing  70
about there? You ought to have put down I the child. Eat with
them those that are spread out there. They will be | for you and
the children. This will be mine." Dog took what she carried I and
threw it down. She took it walking about. | She put it on her back.
She said to him: " There is another disappointment. I was ]| hungry." 1 75
Then she started. She left Misqolo'wum crying. | Then father
and son, Misqolo'wum, were left behind. i Q!ota'ptsek! and hismother
left him. Misqolo'wum was a boy, I therefore he was given to
Coyote. 1I Q!ota'ptsek! was a girl, therefore I she was taken by her 80
mother. Then Misqolo'wum could not help crying. I He knew that
he was left by his mother. Coyote took his son I and said to him
"Don't cry! As your mother is going along there, I if she does not
find anything to eat, she will come back." She had nothing 1| to eat, 85
therefore he said so. What should she have to eat? Then I he and
his son ate shrews. They finished eating together. He put the boy
on his back I and started. He went along. |
(C) COYOTE AND THE BEAVERS
There were some Beavers. He put down his son. He said to him: |
"I'll take them out of the water, and we shall eat them." Then he
broke [I the dens of the Beavers and the beaver dams. I Then there 90
was no more water. He broke open the dens I and took a young
Beaver out of the water. He took another I young Beaver out of the
water. He tied them on his child as ear ornaments. I Beaver saw
him. He was going to get the best of him. He knew [1 it was Coyote. 95
They said to one another: "He will kill us all. I Let us pretend to be
dead." When the Beavers were taken out of the water, they bled
from the mouth. I Then Coyote was glad. He had taken I many
Beavers out of the water. Then he stopped. I He looked for fuel.
Then he went away. The Beavers saw 1[ Coyote going away, and they 100
told one another: "Let us go back I into the water!" Then all the
Beavers went into the water. All jumped back quickly into the
water. I They were not dead. It only looked like blood. | Misqolo'wum's ear ornaments also went into the water. I They dived into
their holes. They dragged Misqolo'wum in. |I They dragged him in. 105
There were two holes, one on each side, and one dived into each..
Then he called his father. Coyote heard his son | saying: "Father,
father! " There was a turn | in the tunnel (into which they had gone).
Coyote knew from far away that his I son was calling him. He ran

making noise in the water. I He went there. His legs stuck out.
lie pulled at them, and took him out. I Then he knocked down the
young Beavers. He looked for I the many Beavers, but only the
bloody ground was left. I The two young Beavers were all he got. II
He made a hole in the ground. Then he made a fire and put the 115
meat into it. I When it was cooked, he took it out. I He put the
fat there for his son because it was soft. I He himself, Coyote, was
going to eat the meat. I Then they ate. He looked again at his
son, and he wished to eat 11 what his son was eating, who was eating 120
fat. He said to his son: I "Let us change!" He put the meat there
and took back (the fat). I Then he ate. He made his son cry.
After they had eaten, | Coyote and his son moved camp.
(d) DEATH OF COYOTE'S SON
He went along. Coyote slipped and fell. II He slid down a long 125
distance until something stopped him. He looked at his son. He
laughed at him. I (Coyote) thought: "Let me make my son glad.
I'll slide down on the snow for a little while." Then he slid
down. I His son did not laugh aloud. He just smiled. Then (Coyote)
thought | he would go back. He thought he would put him again
on his back. He touched him II and he saw him. He was frozen to 130
death. I He cried all the time. He said: "There is I nothing that
should prevent him from being glad (? )" Then I he threw his things
away because his son was dead. He said: "Ah! I This is what people
shall do when their relatives die. [I Then the dead will not be put 135
into bad condition." After I Coyote had thrown his things away, he
started. He went fast. There was nothing j to keep him back.
(e) COYOTE TRIES TO STEAL THE SUN
He went along, and he came to a town. He entered a tent
there. I He sat down. He saw a woman sitting II with her back toward 140
the fire. He saw a child sitting there I which had a big belly. Coyote
thought: "The mother is good, I but the child is bad." The child
said: "Mother, I this manitou thinks his mother is good, but her
child I is bad." He thought: " The child is bad; [1 it knows my mind." 145
The child said: " Mother, I the manitou thinks this child is bad; it
knows my mind." I Coyote thought: " I'll burst his belly by kicking
him." I The child said: "The manitou thinks he is bad. I I will

knew 1I that it was the tent of a chief. There was another I tent, 150
which was not large. A woman came in | where Coyote was. Coyote
looked, and it was his wife. I She said to him: "Why did you say
what the child said? I This is your grandson. Where is the child
that went with you? " I Coyote fell down crying. He said: I "He 155
froze to death." His wife said: I "My tent is near by. Let us
start." Then it was I as he' had told his dead son. He told him:
"Your mother is going; I but if she has no one to share with her what
she eats, she will turn back." Then Dog had no one 11 to share with 160
her what she ate. Then she turned back. Then Coyote took her
back I He entered Dog's tent. Then I she ate. His wife said to him:
" They have I started deer driving." In the evening they will come
back. Don't go in. I In the morning they will do it again. Then
you may go in. I| If you go in in the evening, they will not look at 165
you. I The chief always does that way. He is.the Sun." I At night
the deer drivers came back. Then all went to I the chief's tent.
They piled up the deer. I Then they talked, and they boiled the meat.
All the men II went to the tent. Then (the meat) was being boiled. 1 170
All the children went there, carrying water where the meat was being
boiled. I Coyote always went there. He disobeyed his wife. I He
went with the children who were bringing water. I There at the head
of the tent he threw down his blanket. They brought in water. t1
His blanket was taken and was thrown back to the door. I When 175
Coyote took water into the tent, he saw his blanket. The child I
near the door always spilled water on it I and cleaned his feet
on it. When the meat was done, it was eaten, but nothing
was given to Coyote. II They were passing the food by the place 180
where he was sitting. He stretched his hand out, j but he was
told: "It is not for. you; it is for the next one." I Another one
who was sitting there took it. He was told: " It is not for you; I
it is for him, for that child." Then all the meat was gone, I
and he did not receive anything to eat. Then all went out, and there
was much II food left over. Coyote had nothing left over, because I he 185
was not given anything. Then all went out. Coyote said: [ "Give
me my blanket; I put it there." I He thought that his blanket was
lying at the head of the tent; therefore he said so. He was told: I
"It lies over there." Coyote looked, and there was |I his blanket lying 190
at the door. It was dirty and wet. I Then he took it and went out.
He went into the tent of his wife. I He was told: "Did you eat? Are
you satiated?" Coyote said: | "Oh, no! I was not given anything.

was out of breath. Coyote fell down there. He lay there I[ for a 35

felt something on his hands. He looked at it, and saw I that he had
his hands in the horns of a buffalo bull. He looked at the Grizzly
Bear. I He was standing by his feet. (Coyote) stood up quickly I and
ran after him. He spoke to him in the way a bull bellows, and
Coyote said: I "Fff!" Then Coyote knew that (Grizzly Bear) was 40
afraid of him. I He pursued him. The way Grizzly Bear had done,
that way | Coyote did to him. He also did the same. i Grizzly Bear
looked from side to side over his shoulders. There was a river. He

hit his backside, and he put out the other one I and with it also he

Fox I went out. He staid out the whole night. 1I When it was almost 10
morning, he came back into the tent. Then Coyote arose and I
looked at his friend. He was sleeping with his son. I They did so a
long time for several months. I
Then Coyote said: " I can tell by his eyes that my son has I manitou power. Now let him go and get the toy." He had heard 1f that 15
some one had a good toy. Therefore I he said so to his friend Fox.
Coyote had given to his son I his own manitou power, and his manitou power was Moonlight-just-touching-the-Ground. I Fox gave his
to his son. (It was) Darkness-of-Night. I
Then they started. They went along. After they had gone along
for several days, II they came to a town. They arrived there, and 20
they staid at a distance. I The following afternoon they heard I the
people talking. They said: "Now I play with your toy." Then they
saw I the people coming out-all the men, Il women, and children. 25
They all went there a little distance from their tents. I They brought
it out. Then they carried it into the camp. I Then they began to
shout. They saw how I they began to roll it about. They heard
(saw) that the thing they were rolling about had a nice sound. I
Then they went for it. They caught up with it and kicked it. 1I It 30
made a good sound. They ran for it. Only youths who were very
fast could catch up with it. | It was pretty and bright. I Some time
in the evening they stopped. They took it back I to the farthest
tent. At night before it was very dark | Young Coyote said: "Now
let us go 11 and let us take it!"  His friend said to him: "Nd, I they 35
are not yet asleep, they will see us." It was not long before I Young
Coyote said: "Now let us go! Let us get it!" I The friend said
again: "I said no, the people are not asleep yet." I Then they staid
there. After some time 1| Young Fox knew that it was quiet. All 1 40
were asleep. Young Coyote was told: "Now let us go!" I Then it
was seen that Young Coyote was asleep. I This happened because
he returned early when he was looking for manitou power. Therefore I he slept soundly.  He was told: "Don't sleep! Let us go
there!" 1| Then all the people were asleep. Then | they started. 45
They got there to the farthest tent. They entered; and they saw |
that, although it was dark, it was easily seen, because the toy
looked bright. I They saw two old people asleep in the doorway. |
Each held a hammer. II They were to knock down with the hammer 50
whoever came to steal it. I They went in secretly. (The one) went to
the place where it was hanging, I took hold of it, and cut the string
with which it was hung up. The other one I he.ld the door open.

Then- it did not touch the doorway. I If it had touched it, it would
have given a loud sound. Then 1] they went out. There far off they 55
just touched it a little, I and it gave a slight sound. The old couple at
once got up quickly I when it sounded. They looked for the hoop,
but the toy had disappeared. | The toy was called "hoop." The

way has it been taken?"  It was pointed out to them. I They said:
"There was a little sound of it in that direction." Then 1I the friends 65
were pursued. The people went out. They saw them going. I Then
Young Coyote was told by his friend: "Your father gave you I something, use it." Then Young Coyote untied | Moonlight-just-touchingthe-Ground, and their tracks were lost. It was not long before ] it

Coyote said: "Hiya', my little son!"  Fox said: | "Why did you 95
talk, Coyote? Don't talk! Later on, I when he arrives, we shall know
whose child has been killed." | Then Coyote said no more. He was
just sitting there. Then I Coyote and his friend heard the noise of the
hoop. 1| They felt glad, but they also almost cried when they heard 100
some one saying I that his child had been killed. Then there was
noise of I the hoop. Coyote was told to open the door. | Then Coyote
arose and opened it. I He sat down, and the hoop came rolling in.
It rolled 11 into the tent. It came along rolling. Fox was lying 105
down. I He did not move. Then they heard some one singing. I The
hoop rolled to where Fox was lying. It almost j fell down, but went
rolling on to where Coyote was sitting down. I There the hoop fell
down. Then they told him 1I that Coyote's son was dead. He fell 110
down crying, | and said: "Hiya', my little son, my little son!"
Then Young Fox arrived. I He entered the tent, and he said: "I do
not know what has happened, I but I heard that he was taken. | He
was seen when they lost sight of me. They said among themselves:
'Don't 11 kill him! Since you have lost sight of your toy, he shall 115
become your toy.' Then I went back." I
Then Coyote and his friends lived in the tent. Coyote often said: I
"Let us make war on them!" After some time I his friends said to
him: "Now let us make war on them! 11 Probably the people are no 120
longer uneasy." Then the two friends started. I Young Fox was left
alone. Because he had the toy, I he was not lonesome. Then the
friends reached the town. I They did not go near. The two stopped. I
When the sun was going down, they heard talking there in the town. I|
It was said: "Now go out to play!" ft was not I long before they 125
came out. Everything that I used to be done with the hoop when
they were going to play with it was done now. I Then his son was
taken out. They were all around him. I They saw that his hair was
all cut. 1| He used to have long hair, but now he was changed. Then 130
they kicked him hard. I He started to run, and they pursued him.
When they caught up with him, he was kicked again. I Then Coyote
pitied him. He said: I "Let us go nearer! Let us take him back!"
Fox said: I "Wait, I'll do something!"  He made a sign with his
head. II Then all of a sudden Young Coyote ran fast. They could not 135
overtake him. I Fox again made a sign with his head, and Young
Coyote started again. I They could not catch up with him. He made
a turn. I Fox made a quick sign with his head. Then Young Coyote

with him. I Therefore they laughed about it. Young Coyote came
along. I They could not catch up with him at all. Then he came
to I where the parents were. Fox and his friend arose. I Then it
was known that he had taken back his son. They told one another:ll
"Don't look at Coyote and his friend! They are bad. | They might. 145

was a good I gambler, therefore they started to gamble. Long ago || it 155
was known that Coyote was a good gambler,. but he did not keep it
up. | Therefore they tried their luck with him; but Fox never gambled. I They thought he was a bad gambler. Then Salmon arrived, I
traveling by canoe. They were young men, and one (woman) their
sister I went with them. When they arrived, (Salmon) said to Coyote
and his friend: "Letus 1I play!" Coyote said: "Whatshallweplay? I 160
He was told: "The hiding game (lehal)." Coyote said: I "Well, let
us gamble!" Then they made a fire outside, and they began to
gamble. Coyote said: "Don't i let him gamble! Your son and my
son shall be partners."  Then II they played. It was not long before 165
Coyote lost the game; and I he played again, and Coyote lost. Then l
he lost everything. Young Fox and his uncle had lost I the hoop.
That is what they wanted to get. Coyote sat down, I and said to
Young Fox: "Go to your father II and tell him to give me the thing 170
striped crosswise." Young Fox went. I He said to his father: "Uncle I
says you shall give him the thing striped crosswise." Fox thought:
"What I does he mean? He did not give me anything. Why should
he say that?" He said I to his son: "Go to him and ask him what
he means." 11 He went back, and Coyote was told: "My father says he 175
doesn't know I what you mean."  Coyote said: "Oh, how should I
he not know it? Go to him and tell him not I to keep it from me
because he likes it." The child went back and came to his father. I He
said to him: "He says you should not keep it back because you like it,

partridge I tail and gave it to him. He said to him: "I think he
meant just this. I He must have meant it." (The boy) took it back
and gave it to Coyote. 11 He was told: "My father says you must 185
have meant this." I Coyote said: "What else should I mean?" I Fox
said: "Don't gamble for a while. I shall go." I Coyote was told:
"My father said you should wait for him. I He is coming."  Then
Fox got ready. 11 It was not long before Coyote shouted, saying: You 1 190
let me wait. I ought to have back already what I have lost."

Then I he went there, and they gambled. He moved his hands in
the game and sang. I He sang thus: 1
"Whenever I am pointed out, the gambling bone will disappear." [  195

it. I Coyote said: "Wait; paddle ashore! I'll carry the child alongshore." II The woman did not want to do it. She cried. i Then they 225
arrived at the cascade. Fox knew I that the woman was angry with
them. Fox had a bladder. I He told Coyote and his son: "Go into
this I bladder." Then Coyote, his son, and Fox went in. i[ Fox had his 230
pipe in the hole of the bladder. Then I the canoe upset and sank.
The woman thought I they were dead, but the bladder floated.
Farther down the river I the canoe came up again. The woman
looked back, I and there they were sitting together. They were not
dead. 11
She turned back. Not far away there was another cascade, I a still 235
more terrible one. Coyote said: "Wait; I'll I carry my grandchild
along the shore." The woman did not look at him. Then I they
arrived there, and Fox worked again at his bladder. I Coyote, Fox,
and the boy went in again. 1| He held the pipe at the edge of the 240
hole. Then their canoe went down again. I A little farther down the
river the canoe emerged again. I Coyote, Fox, and the child came
out. The woman looked at them, | and they all sat down together,
and again she had not killed them.

shall kill all of them." There was a smooth precipice there. I They
went ashore. The woman landed, and kicked I the canoe. She thought
she would upset it. I Then they climbed up a bad place. The friends
did not know what to do I when they came to the bad place, but Fox
had thrown tobacco on it. Then [I they went on, and the friends 250
reached the top. There was a tent. When the woman entered, I she
said: "I bring them all; kill them all." She meant (spoke to) [ her
elder brother. When the friends arrived there, a young man was
lying down. I He arose and went out. Two old women also arose. I
Each took a dish and they went out. After some time || the twe 255
came back again, carrying (the buckets) filled with dog manure. I
They threw it into the fire. Then all the people covered their heads
and I lay down. The dog manure was burning, I and therewas bad
smoke in the house. Fox did the same thing with the bladder. I
After some time there was no smoke. They took off II their blankets 260
and they looked at Fox. They were all sitting there together, [ and
again they had been unable to kill them. [

ing they started. Fox was to paddle, I| Young Coyote was to spear 265
(thefish), and the boy was to carry the torch. I Coyote was to remain(in
the tent)., Coyote was told: I "Don't sleep. Look at the I fire. If
you should fall asleep, they will kill you." Then they paddled away. I
Fox paddled. Young Coyote was the one to spear II the salmon, and 270
the boy was to hold the torch. I Coyote remained (in the tent) for
some time. I Coyote looked out. Coyote was told: | "If you should
see a small fire, then come out. Then I we are about to kill one another. For that reason the fire will be thus." 1I It was not long before 275
he looked out again. Then he saw that the fire I in the canoe was
small. Then he knew that they were about to kill I one another.
There on each side of the doorway stood an old person. I They were
holding a hammer each, ready to strike with it | if any one should
want to go there. Then they would strike from each side. When
he saw the light in the canoe getting smaller, 1I he intended to go out. 280
It was not long before | the boy came running in, and said: I "The
manitous have killed us!" Coyote thought: I "I shall certainly die.
That hammer is terrible. Although only an old woman I is holding
it, nevertheless the hammer is made of stone, and she will 11 kill me 285
with it." Coyote jumped there. He thought: "I'll fool them!"
When that old woman saw that he I was about to go out, then the
old people lifted their hammers I to hit him. They both stood with
legs apart, ready to strike Coyote. I They were about to knock him
down. Then Coyote jumped there. I1 He stopped quickly. The 290
old people thought I he would jump through between them, and
they struck; I but since Coyote stopped quickly, the old people
struck each other right on their heads. They | hit each other and
killed each other. Then II Coyote started to go to the place where they 295
had landed. He went there I and got there. Then Fox and Young
Coyote paddled ashore. I They were just telling each other: "Certainly
the old woman has knocked down I Coyote, therefore he has not come
to the shore." I Then Coyote talked, and said: "I am here. The
old people have not killed me. 11 I have made trouble for them." Then 300
he laughed aloud. I He laughed thus: "So, so, so!" Fox knew now I
that he had killed the old people, and that he laughed for this reason,
He said to him: | "Hurry up! Come aboard! Those who | make war
on us are coming." I1

went down to the river. Then l he transformed himself into a salmon.

He was going to attack I Fox and his friends. He thought he would
kill them, because he had been beaten I| when he had gone to play 310
with them. (I have been all the time making a mistake. I It was
Young Coyote who paddled, and Fox who speared the salmon.)
Then they paddled along. I They saw a salmon. Fox knew it was I
the youth who had come out the day before. He knew I1 that he had 315
turned into a salmon. When Fox was ready to throw his spear, I
the boy put the torch to the other side. He did this so I that Fox
should not hit the salmon, | for the one to be speared was his elder
brother. Fox knew what | the boy was doing. He thought: "I'll
fool him!" I1 The fish was coming along on one side, but he pointed 320
the other way. | He said to the youth: "Salmon is coming there." I
He fooled him in regard to the side whence it was coming. I The
youth turned the torch, and Fox speared him. I When the youth saw
that Fox had fooled him, [I he said to him.: " Don't hit it in the belly; 1 325
hit its tail!" The youth thought I the salmon would kill Fox if he
should hit its tail, I because then he would upset the canoe. When
Fox was told: "Don't hit its belly," he would not listen, but he
hit it 11 in the belly. The salmon at once turned sideways. I The boy 330
saw that his brother was killed. Then I he stepped on one side of the
canoe, fell into the water, I and became a salmon. I Then he went back
to his tent and arrived there. Then 1| he said: " They have killed us." 335
He thought the one remaining might also be killed, I as two had been
killed. Then three had been killed.' I Then Fox and his friends went
on paddling. | The youth who had been killed wore ear ornaments.
They cut off his head i and put it into the canoe. He also had a long
braid. 11 (In olden times the people used to do this. When they 340
made war and some one killed i a chief, they cut off his head and took
it back to their country.) | Then in the morning Coyote and his son
were told: "Don't I look back!" They paddled on. At sunrise I
many people from a large camp II came to make war on Fox. Coyote 345
thought: I "They are already paddling after us." He looked back [
and said: "A great many are making war on us." I Fox told him:
"Why don't you obey me and do I what I tell you? Don't look
back!" Then 11 Coyote and his friends stopped. No matter how hard 350
they tried, I they could not move their canoe. Then the warriors
arrived. ] (Fox) took the head of the youth. | He lifted it up and

It sank. Again they paddled, and their canoe moved right away. I|
They were saved. Then the crowd stopped I on the water when the 355
head of the youth sank. I Fox went on. They did not look back
again. |
(f) TURTLE RESCUES THE SALMON HEAD
Then the one who was the father of the youth said: "Who I will
get this head of my son? I have one more child, 1 a daughter. He 360
shall marry her." Then all the people ' dived. They went into the
water, but could not get it. Just at I noon Turtle-a young man
called I Turtle-said: "I'll dive. Turtle, I the animal, said to me I I
should do it, because you know [I Turtle is an expert diver. I'll try." 1 365
Thus said Turtle. Then that youth said: J "I'll dive. You shall
paddle back to the shore to your tents. I To-morrow, just at noon, I'll
come out of the water; I then paddle back here."  Then they went
back. 11 On the following day, just at noon, they said to one another: 1 370
"Turtle was to come up at this time. Go back to him." Then I they
all paddled back and waited for him. Just at noon | he emerged,
carrying the head of the youth. I Then he took the girl. For several
days she was 1[ his wife. For one or two days she did not talk. Then 1 375
he teased her to make her talk, but she wouldn't talk with him.
Then I he tickled her, and she laughed. Her mouth had a bad smell. [

'59. COYOTE AND THE DUCS 1
Well, I'll tell you about Coyote and his children I-what they did,
a long time ago, to the Ducks. i
Coyote was going along, carrying his son. IIe went down to a
lake. I It is named Where-they-fight-with-Broken-Pieces-of-Wood
in-the-Lake. 1] Coyote knew that far away there were many I Ducks.  5
He was hungry for them, but had no way of getting at them. He
thought: I "I'll fool the Ducks." He said to his son: "Go on; I
shout, 'O my father's brothers-in-law "' Then the child I said what
his father had told him. Then Coyote also II cried. He shouted: "0 10
my brothers-in-law! 0 my brothers-in-law!" Then I one Duck was
swimming farther away on the water. He said I to his children:
"Wait; listen [to] what the manitous I are saying!" There were
many Ducks. They listened I to what the manitous were crying.

Some one said: "Go ashore 11 and ask him something." Then one of 15
them went ashore. I He said to him: "Why do you say that."
Coyote said: | "We wanted you. You are playing nicely. | We are
not able to go on the water."  The Duck started, and said: I "They
are wishing for us. They want to have our way of playing." Thenli
one of them said: "Go ashore. Take them I and play with them.' 20
Then the Ducks went ashore. They made it so that I Coyote and his
son should not sink, but they did not give them I their feathers.
Coyote and his son were told: "Now I let us go together!" Then
they went out together-Coyote, his son, and the Ducks. II Then they 25
played with the Ducks. While they were at play, all the Ducks I flew
along to another lake. They flew there. I Coyote went ashore overland. When he came to the water, he swam, I but the Ducks flew
again to the other lake. I All at once Coyote laid down a rule. He 30
said to them: 11 "It is bad for you to fly away. Don't do it any
more. I Swim there through the middle of the water. I Arrange yourselves in a line right across, and all of you dive together." Then I the
Ducks said to one another: "It is good, what the manitou says. I Let
us do it!"  Then the Ducks did so. [1 At night Coyote went ashore. 35
He stepped on shore. I Then Coyote made something to stretch
across I the brook. Then the Ducks came diving along, and did not do
anything. I The first one he tied, the next one that came diving
along | he let go, and the last one that dived coming along he tied
again. He said 1] to- the Ducks: "When you start diving, close your 40
eyes. | Don't look!" Coyote was clever. I (He thought) they might
see his trap. They I did so for several days. Then Coyote had much
food. I The Ducks just knew that they ceased to be many. They
said among themselves: I1 "We are gettingfew in number." One Duck 45
said: I "The wind is blowing from the place where Coyote's tent is. I
It gives a smell of burnt fat. Now go and look into his | tent." One
Duck was called Great Diver.1 | He dived and came to Coyote's
tent. He went ashore, and saw II many dried ducks. Then he 50
knew that it was I Coyote. He went back; and when he came
back, he said: "It is I Coyote. He is killing all of us."  Then the
Ducks cried. I The Ducks said among themselves: "He will do the
same to us to-morrow. I Look out when you dive! You will see|l
whether there is anything in the stream." Then I on the following 55
day the Ducks started diving to another lake. I The first ones all
looked, and it was not long before they saw I something right across
1 Mot-head (?).

the water. They dived and went back. Coyote said: I "Oh, you
have a (good) mind! I was going to kill you all." 1I The Ducks did 60
not do it any more, but flew again. [
There was the tent of Lynx. IIe went out. The wind was
blowing this way, | and he smelled the burning fat. He started, following the smell, I and arrived at the lake. He saw that Coyote had
much to eat. I Then he made him sleep; and both slept, I —Coyote and 65
his son. Lynx took the Ducks. i Ie took Coyote by his tail and
pulled it. Then he had a long tail; | and he also took his son. He
took his face and pulled it | so that he had a long face. Then he
started back. Coyote's son woke up, I and he saw (his father) sleeping. He saw that he had a long face 11 and a long tail. Then the 70
son laughed at him I because he was that way. He woke him up.
IIe looked at his son, | and he saw that he was different from what he
~had been;.I and he looked at the Ducks, and there was no food.
They staid there. I He said to his son: "I'll go that way." Coyote
started [1 and saw a tent. He knew it was the tent of Lynx. I He 75
knew that he had stolen the food. He made him sleep, I and he took
back the Ducks. He took hold of his tail I and pushed it in, and he
did the same to his son. Just a little piece of the tail remained
sticking out. j He took his face and pushed it in, 11 and he had a short 80
face. Then he went back. Lynx and his son awoke. ] They saw
how they were, and that. there was no food. I Therefore Coyote has a
long nose and a long tail. I Lynx did it. And therefore Lynx i has
a short nose and a short tail. Coyote did it. [[
Now I have told you about Coyote, wht he did to I the ducks 85
long ago. |

Well, I'll tell you a story how Panther was killed by Coyote.
(a) COYOTE KILLS PANTHER
Coyote had a tent. He was married to Dog. In the evening I
Dog said: "To-morrow you shall go to your uncle. I His tent is
there. His name is Panther. He is not hungry, but (( he is very 5
stingy."  On the following morning Coyote arose. I He said: "Give
me my clothes." Dog gave I Coyote his clothing. Then he started,
and arrived I where the tent of Panther was. He entered. Oh,
there was much meat. I His wife was scraping fat off a skin. His
children were cleaning guts. II Panther was putting feathers on his 10
arrows. They did not look at him. He sat down, and I thought:

"Maybe they did not see me." He went out again. He went back
coughing. I He went in again. They did not look at him, I and he sat
down. They did not give him anything to eat, and he was hungry
when he saw the meat. I He was very hungry. He went out and
went home without anything to eat. 11 He arrived at his tent. 1  15
In the evening he said: "To-morrow we will move. I My food is
there. I did not bring it."  Dog thought: "He was stingy, therefore he did so." On the following morning they moved their camp. I
When they got there, Coyote said to his wife: "Oh, go quickly 11 and 20
get meat, that you may eat!" Dog left I for that tent. She entered,
but they did not look at her. She sat down. J She said.: "I came
for the food that you gave to Coyote." I They did not look at her.
After a long time she went out. She did not get anything to eat. |
She was hungry when she saw the meat. She was poor. She went
back 1I and said: "They didn't give me anything." 1      25
Coyote said: "Try again. It may be given to you. It is hanging
ready made by the doorway." Dog went there again. She entered, and they did not look at her. She looked up. I She saw it
hanging here. It was all tied up. II She said: "Is this it?" Then 30
she took it. I Panther looked around, and saw that she was taking
it down. | A stone was lying there. He took it; and when Dog put
her arm up, I he struck her with the stone. He struck her hard right
on the breast. I Panther said: "Oh, you bad-looking one! II This is 35
not for you. I am hunting for my children." | Then Dog ran out
quickly, howling. I
When she came back, Coyote heard his wife. He uttered his war
cry I and ran out quickly. He split a young tree I to make a bow,
and made a small bow for his son. II He made a hammer for his wife, 40
and for his daughter | a small hammer. He said to them: "Let us
go now! I I'll go against my fellow man;-you go against I your fellow
woman.-You shall go against I your boy companion,-and you shall
go against your girl II companion." Then they started. They reached 45
there, and he said I to his wife: "Open the door for me." ] Then Dog
opened the door for her husband, and he shot into the tent of I Panther.
He shot in again. Then Coyote attacked Panther. I He took him
and held him. When he knew that II he was dead, he put him down. 50
He looked, and just then (the female Panther) was -taking I the
hammer from his wife. She was about to strike her with it. I Then he
attacked her and took it from that woman. He took it from her
and I struck her down. He looked, and just then his son was about
to shoot I with his bow. (The Panther boy) took it from him. 1 (Coy- 55

attacked that girl and knocked her down. He had killed them all.
He said to them: "Now pull their skins off. Don't tear them." |
They did so. They skinned them entirely. Then they put them
outside. II They dragged them to an old fallen stump, and I Coyote 60
moved into Panther's tent. Then he put feathers on his arrows. |
His wife scraped the fat off the skin, and his children cleaned I the

Then it was evening. Dog knew what Panther used to' do, II and 65
she told Coyote about it. Then they did I what Panther used to do.
He arose, and called all of them. I He called the Game. He said:
" Oh, I come down quickly!" At once they heard noise coming down
from the mountains. [ They put pitchwood on the fire, and the Game
came in. II The first one he shot. They began to come in, and the 70
last one I he also shot. Then there was no more. They slept. I The
following morning they went out, and there were two sheep lying
there. He skinned them. I Then Coyote put feathers on his arrow.
Dog cleaned I the fat off the skin, and the children cleaned the guts.
When it was dark, Coyote II did the same. He said' "Oh, it's no use 75
to try to do what you ought to do!" ] Again he called the Game.
Then, I when it came in, he shot. He kept on shooting all. I He shot,
he shot, he shot, until his arrows were spent I and there was no more
game. Then he slept. On the following morning 11 he went out. 80
There were only two of them. The big number (which he had shot)
were not there. I
In the evening he heard a sound on the mountains. I Those whom
he had shot were making a noise. It was the noise of their suffering. I Then in the evening the Game Animals said to one another:
"That is not Panther. Why does he do that to us? I Go and look
and see who it is." Little Flathorn started. |I When he arrived, he 85
went where the wind was blowing. I He smelled a stench. He went
there, and saw [ Panther and his children piled up. He came to his
tent, I looked in, and saw that Coyote was there. Then I he started
back. He was not far away when he began to snort. Coyote said: II
"Oh, what does the Game say? " After a little while, I when he was 90
farther away, he snorted again; and Coyote said again: "Oh, the
Game found something!" Then Little Flathorn got back I and told
his relatives: I "That is not Panther; it is Coyote. Ifound Pantherll 95
and his children piled up there, all killed."

Coyote thought the Game would begin to come down, I but all at once 100
all the Game Animals threw down stones. They all threw stones at |
Coyote. Then Coyote knew that I the Game Animals were making
war on him. At once he got ready. I He did as he always does when
going to war. He put stripes on himself 11 and pinned tail feathers 105
of the red flicker on himself. I Then he gave a war cry and jumped
sideways. I His whole tent was torn up by the stones. I His son
Q!uta'ptsek! was knocked down. Then three, Misqolo'wum | and her

Misqolo'wum was knocked down. Now two were left, Coyote and 110
his wife. | They two jumped back and forth. Then Dog also was
knocked down, | and Coyote alone was left over. He was jumping
back and forth. I Then there were no more stones up on the mountain, | and the Game Animals did not roll down any more. They
picked up some more, [1 and after some time they found stones. Then 115
there were no more. Coyote was standing there. I They could not
kill him. I
Little Flathorn went that way. There a small sharp flat stone
was lying. I He hit Coyote with it. He said: I "Well, look out,
Coyote!"  Coyote was standing there. 11 He heard a noise. He said: 120
"Hey!" It was a | thin stone which made the noise. Then he put
his I head sideways quickly. He was listening for the noise. I He was
hit hard on the, head and was knocked down. I He began to fall, and

In the evening I Coyote sang again. He said to the Salmon: I "In
the evening three of you shall go into the trap." Then Coyote
slept. I In the morning he said to his wife: "Tell your father I1 to go 270
down to his trap." Sparrow went there, and saw I three salmon. He
went ashore, spoke, and said: I "Spear the three salmon in the
trap." They went down I and speared them. Then they assembled
and ate them. Then they had almost I enough to eat, because there
were three salmon. In the evening II Coyote went down and said to 275
the Salmon: " Now I fill up the fish trap. In the morning he said to his
wife, I 'Tell your father to go down early to his trap.'" In the morning I Sparrow went down. He saw that the fish trap was full at I that
place. Then he went ashore, spoke, and said: "Boys, 1| take your 280
spears and spear and throw I ashore the salmon.  They are almost
breaking the trap. I There are plenty of them." Then they went
down. It was seen that the salmon almost I broke it. Then all the
men speared them, I and. the women carried them ashore. Then 1I they 285

staid there. He already had two children. ]
He said: "Now I'll go to some other place."  Then he left his

61. ORIGIN OF THE SEASONS
Well, I will tell you a story of what happened long ago in this
world. They were staying at a certain place a long time ago, I and
summers and winters were long. |
There was a town. It was winter time. A man l! named Coyote  5
went into the tent of an old woman, who gave him [ food. The old
woman was named Squirrel. Squirrel said: I "There is no more
food, and it is along time | before spring will come. What shall I do?
There is no more food." Coyote said: I "Well, cry. Then if the
people come in and ask you, 11 'Why do you cry?' don't answer. 10
When they have all spoken to you, i I shall say to you, 'Do you say I
that your food will be gone long before spring comes?' Then you will
say, 1 'Yes!'"  Then Coyote went out. I
Squirrel thought that what he had said was good. II Then she  15
cried. She cried aloud. The people in the town said: I "What is

the old woman saying?"  They went there,and questioned her.
She did not speak. She was just crying aloud. I Then all had questioned her, but the old woman did not speak. Coyote went there. |
He said to the old woman: "Do you say II that you will have no more 20
food for a long time?"  Then the old woman cried no more. She
said: I "Yes!" The people said: "What shall vwe do to make spring
come?" i
There was another town, and there they kept I the seasons. After
twelve months had passed, these I people would untie the springtime
and the summer time and 1| the fall of the year. Then they would tie 25
up again the winter. I Therefore they said: "What shall we do with
them?" They said among themselves: I 'Let us go and steal it!" I
Then they started. Now, those up in the sky counted that the
winter would last six | months, and that six months more would pass 11
before spring came. They arrived at that town, and said: "Who- 30
ever I can walk secretly shall go there."  There was a boy. I It was
known that he could walk secretly. He was told: "You shall stealit."
Then I he started. He almost came to the tent. He worked I his
manitou power. After he had done so, his manitou spoke to him,
and told him!1 what he was to do when he entered, and where it was 35
hanging. He took some gum. | He entered the tent; and when he
arrived, they said: | "Whoever can throw farthest shall take it, after
it has been thrown out., I Then he shall throw it away; and the one
who is strongest shall stay on I the prairie on the hillside. It will be
thrown there; and when he catches it, II he shall tear it at once." 1 40
There was one very strong man. His manitou was I Grizzly Bear.
He was told: "You shall tear it."  Then I the youth went in. He
saw an old woman standing there. I She said to him: "It is midwinter."  Then he said to her: II "Where is the springtime?" He was 45
told: "It is hanging there." I He said to her: "Where is the summer?" and she told him. I He was holding the gum. He held it in
his hand close to the fire. | The old woman thought that he was
warming his hands, for it was cold. I She did not know that he was
heating the gum. After some time [! it melted. Then he attacked the 50
old woman and stuck I (the gum) on her mouth. Then he went to get
the thing in which she had said [ the springtime was kept. He pulled
it off and carried it out. Then the old woman I ran out quickly. She
intended to speak, but could not speak. | (The gum) was stuck on
her mouth. It was just seen that 11 the old woman was moving her 55
arms, pointing in a certain direction. They went that way. I When
they got there, she pointed to her tent. She pointed that way. I
They looked in, and the springtime was gone. They looked for it, I
and it was known that the people were carrying it away. I Then
they made war on them. They wanted to kill all those who had
stolen it. When 11 they were about to overtake them, another one 1 60

went along. He saw a man | running along and stopping. Coyote
went there. He saw II the man running along and stopping again. 5
He saw | that he was looking up. He went on and arrived there. I
The man did not see him. He saw that he stopped again and that
he was taking out I his eyes to throw them up. I Then he ran to the
place where the eyes were going. The man stopped 11 and looked up. 10
His eyes came back down, and I he had his eyes again. I
Coyote thought: "Well, I'll take his eyes." i Then he went behind him. (The man) did not see him. He stopped again. I He
took them out and threw them up. He started to run. ]1 Coyote also 15
ran after them and caught the eyes. I Then the man looked up, but his
eyes did not come down again. I He was without eyes. He went on.
The one without eyes was named Snipe. I Now Snipe had no eyes. I
He went on. Coyote went ahead there and started. [| He stretched 20
out his fingers and just put them into Snipe's orbits. I Snipe almost
fell down. Then he went on, I and Coyote did the same again, and
he almost put his fingers again I into his orbits. Snipe thought:
"It is just as though I somebody was doing this. If it should happen
again, 11 even if it hurts, I shall not mind it. I shall just stretch my 25
hands out." | Coyote did so again. Even though it hurt him, I Snipe
just stretched out his hands. Hefelt that there was a man, I and he
took hold of him. When Coyote knew that he was caught, he said:
"Oh, I don't do anything to me! I will give youyour eyes." |I Snipe 30
would not listen. Coyote was caught. I His eyes were taken out, and
1 The young man who stole the bag containing the spring was Lynx.

(Coyote) | had taken his eyesfrom him. Then Snipe ran away, I and
Coyote had no eyes. Snipe went back 11 to his town. When he ar- 35
rived, he said: "I brought I here Coyote's eyes." Coyote went
along. I He was poor. He knew there were trees. He thought | the
gum would be good. He felt for it, and noticed gum hanging down.
He took it off and put it in. He could see with it. He looked for I|
another one. Then it was good. He took it and stuck it on. I Then 40
Coyote had his eyes back. He started. He saw the place from which
Snipe I had come. He went along. It was hot, and the gum melted. I
It fell down, and Coyote was again without eyes. He went along.
Then | he was poor.again. He knew there was a creek there. He
thought: 11 "The foam will be good." He felt for it.' He found it 45
and I stuck it on, and Coyote had eyes again. He started and went
along. I The foam was soft. It burst, and Coyote was again without eyes. I He went along and heard a child speaking. I He said:
"Sister!"  He also heard some one calling. "What is it?" II said 50
that child. "Here is a big berry patch." I Coyote thought: "There
must be huckleberries."  He felt for them with his hands. I He
knew there were huckleberries. He picked off a big one I and put it
in his eyes. Then Coyote had eyes again. He had huckleberries
for his eyes. | He thought: "Now I have eyes again." He went to
where II the child was calling for his sister. The child thought I that 55
his sister was coming. He did not look. When Coyote arrived, I he
took hold of the child, took out his eyes, and so I he had eyes again.
Then he went there where there were many huckleberries. I He said:
"Sister, here is a big berry patch."  Then he 11 sat down. The girl 60
went there where I her younger brother was sitting. She picked berries. Coyote arose and I went there. He took hold of the girl and
took out her eyes. I
Then he started and came to the town. There at one end I was
the tent of an old woman. He entered and ate. He said to her:]]
"What are they doing in this town?" He was told: | "Coyote's eyes 65
were brought here. They are using them to obtain good luck. |
After a little while my granddaughters will come. They will carry
me." I He said to her: "Do you sing?" The oldwoman said: I "I
am old. Only young men and women dance." II Then he killed the 70
old woman, took off her skin, I and threw away her body. He went
into her skin I and sat down. After a short time her granddaughters, I
two girls, came. When they arrived, they said: "Grandmother, I we
came to get you. They are dancing again. We will take you over
there." II Then they took Coyote on the back.  He was carried 75

along. I While he was being carried there, he said to the girls:
"I will sing, I will dance." I
When the two girls arrived, they said: I "The old woman also
wants to dance."  Snipe said: 11 "Well, she also shall dance."  Then  80
they danced. | Coyote knew what was done. | The old woman' was
told: "Now you sing!" Then, I while the dancing was going on,
they sang- I
"Try to get good luck out of Coyote's, Coyote's eyes!" 11
The old woman sang that which was said. She also I said so. She 85
was not an old woman; she was Coyote. There was no I light where
they were dancing. The two girls were told: i "Let the old woman
stand up. Lead her. She is poor." I Then the two girls made their
grandmother stand up. II They danced. They tried hard, because 90
the old woman was singing. I They were glad. They danced for a
longtime. I Then the old woman said: "Let go what you sing about." I
They carried the eyes of Coyote. Then Coyote carried i his eyes.
They were dancing about. ]| Then it was noticed that (the voice) of 95
the old woman was going down. I She was almost out of breath.
Almost they could hear her no more. I Then she was heard singing
by the doorway. Then she was not heard any more. I They stopped,
and did not dance any more. They said: I "Bring a light! Look for
the old woman! She may have died of fatigue." 1I Light was made, 100
and they looked for the old woman. Then they saw the skin lying
there. | The old woman was gone. I Only her skin remained. They
heard Coyote some distance away. He laughed, I and they said: "It
was Coyote, it was not the old woman, [ who danced. Coyote killed
her. It was only I1 her skin." 1                           105
Now I have told you what Coyote did to I his eyes.
63. COYOTE AND DEER
I'll tell you how Coyote made the I Deer. {
There was a town. Long ago the Deer used to bite the people. I
They never went out hunting. Only the men who were skillful II went  5
hunting. Those who were unskillful were bitten by the Deer. J There
was that town. They were hungry because the Deer was bad. I
Coyote thought: "Let me go hunting!" He was told: I "Don't go
hunting! The Deer might bite you." Coyote said: "Oh, I I'll work
my manitou power. The Deer shall not bite me." 11 Coyote started. 10
That is, Coyote.

Then he worked his manitou power. ] He said to the manitou power:
"Tell me, what shall I do to that Deer? i I want to change it. Later
on there will be many people I in this world. What will they do for
their food I It might always kill them."  His manitou said: "It is
good. I1 I will tell you. Go on! and if the Deer runs after you, | take 15
it and pull out its teeth I and make it so that its meat shall be good,
and I make a tail for it." Then Coyote started. I He went, and the
Deer smelled him. Then the Deer pursued him. 1I There was a bunch 20
of little trees in the direction from which the wind came. Coyote
went around this way. t He saw a thicket. Deer made noise, and he
noticed I that it would go for him. He put down his bow. Then he
saw I the Deer coming out. Coyote ran after it and took it. He took
it I by the mouth and pulled out its teeth. Then he held it, 11 and he 25
made its body good. He took grass, nice I grass, and stuck it on.
After he had changed it, he let it go, and said to it: I "Go on, snort!
Go this way!" Then Deer I snorted and went along. It put up its
tail quickly. I The Deer was nice. Its body was nice. Its tail was
nice. II Coyote said to the Deer: "Now I have finished with you. 1 30
Look at yourself! Look how nice you are! Now don't I bite people!
You shall be afraid of them. When you see them, I you shall snort.
You shall run away. I Only skillful people shall kill you. Unskillful
ones II shall not kill you. Later on, when there are many people and 35
when there will be enough i to kill animals, you may be killed."
Then Coyote finished making things good. I
Coyote started on, and he saw a Deer and killed it. i He went on
and killed another one. Then II he went back. He carried two Deer. 40
He reached the town. I A little ways from the town, children I were
playing. They just looked at him, and he scared them with the two
Deer he was carrying, I because they used to kill people. He said to
the children: I "Why are you looking at me? ~ Shout for joy! 1| That 45
is what children will say. Later on, when there are many people and
when children see I somebody carrying meat, they will shout for joy.
Then it will be known in the town I that somebody is bringing meat.
Therefore the children shall shout." I The children did not know how
to do it. I Coyote said to them: " Say 'Hohowu!'"  Then 1] the chil- 50
dren all said so. When they heard what the children were saying,
they all said: ] "Why do' your children say that " I They came out

hunting. I will change the Deer, and it will not bite you; | but the
Deer is wild." I
Now I have told what Coyote did long ago I to the Deer. I
64. COYOTE AND TREE CHIEF1
Well, I will tell you about Tree Chief. |
(a) COYOTE BECOMES TREE CHIEF'S FRIEND
There was Coyote. He heard about a youth. I There was a youth.
He thought: "I'll go, I and the youth shall be my friend, because it is
said II that he is clever."  The name of this youth was Tree Chief. | 5
Coyote started. He went along. He met a mule. Coyote took him
and rode him. Because his legs were lean, I he took moss and stuffed
his legs. Then I he had big calves. Tree Chief's tent was on a river. I[
Coyote came riding along on the mule i opposite (the tent). When 10
Tree Chief's mother saw him, the old woman said: I "Oh, I wish the
passer-by would be my son's friend!" I Coyote heard her talking. I
He went past. He left his mule and came it to the old woman. He 15
entered, and said to her: "What did you say I when I passed there
on the other side?."  The old woman saw that I he was a youth.
She was pleased with him. She said I to Coyote: "I said this: 'I
wish you would be my son's friend."' I She did not know that it
was Coyote. Therefore [[ she took him to be her son's friend. She 20
knew that I her son was to be a chief. There was Coyote I in his
friend's tent. |
(b) COYOTE TRIES TO KILL TREE CHIEF
After several days he said to his friend: "Let us go to the town!" I
He knew that it was true that II the youth was going to do something. 25
He had heard there in the town I while he was there [he was told] that
the chief would give I his daughter to that youth. Therefore he
thought I he would make him his friend. He wanted to kill him
and take the I chief's daughter for himself. They went along a trail. II
The youth did not want to leave his mother's tent. He would never 30
go I to the big town. When Coyote had become his friend, I he took
him along. Coyote saw a pit. It was | a trap of Wolf. Coyote
thought: "Here I I shall kill my friend." Then they arrived there.
1 Literally, "different kind of tree,"

Coyote was talking all the time. [| He pointed at everything, so that 35
his friend should | not look at the place where he was to step. I Then
they had almost arrived at the pit. The pit was I hardly visible
because it was a trap. If anything goes along there, i it falls into it;
everything-deer, grizzly bear, II everything-dies there in the pit. 40
The friends went there. I They arrived; and while Coyote was pointing at different things, | he pushed his friend. He threw him into
the pit. I Coyote looked, and said: "Hya, friend! I shall have no I
way of getting you out, for the pit is deep." He just said so on
purpose. 11 He said to him: "Throw up your clothing, I then I'll get 45
you up." Coyote pulled I his friend slightly. He could not get him
up with his tail. His blanket | was his tail. Therefore he told him
that he could not do any more, I but he was telling him a lie.
He did not pull. Then Tree Chief II threw up his war bonnet. 50
He threw up everything. [ Then he was without clothing. Coyote
said: "Spit up your spittle." I Then Tree Chief had no more spittle. I
It became sea shells. I A sparrow hawk was sitting on his head.
When II he spat, his spittle changed into shells, and I the sparrow 55
hawk ate them. When I Coyote had taken everything, he left. He
had | a shield. He had a tomahawk. He had a war bonnet.
He had the sparrow hawk. t His clothing was fringed. I1
He arrived at the town. He came out on a prairie, I and shouted. 60
The people said: "Oh, Tree Chief has arrived!" \ He was coming
along. He came nearer, and arrived at | the town. He was told:
"There is the tent of the chief! " They thought I that he was coming
to marry the chief's II daughter, according to what the chief had said. 65
He entered, and the place was ready prepared for him, I because he
was a chief. His wife I was glad when he came. The girl did not
know I that he was Coyote. He had staid at this town already. I
When he came back, she did not know that he was (not) her husband. iI She was glad. Coyote sat down. He had the sparrow hawk. 1 70
When he spat, the sparrow hawk would fly down I to eat the shells.
Then it flew back I to his head. When his sisters-in-lawknew that I
his spittle was thus, they took it, and 1I the bird would not eat any 75 -more. It was not long before the sparrow hawk was starving. I Then
Coyote let the sparrow hawk starve, and he had no saliva. I Now,
the chief had made a mistake. I The name of the chief was Golden
Eagle. i

(c) WOLF RESCUES TREE CHIEF
An old man named Wolf lived there. He was an expert II hunter. 80
Therefore he was named Wolf. In the morning Wolf J started for his
trap. He got there, and it was broken. I He thought that there must
be something in his trap. | He looked down into the pit and saw a small
child sitting there. I He said to him: "You soiled this place for me."
The child caused him to think: II "Don't kill me. Go back to your 85
wife, I then come back with her." Wolf started back, and arrived at
his tent. I He said to his wife: "Let us go! There is I a child in my
trap. We will take him out." Then I the couple went. They arrived,
and the old woman looked II for the child. She thought his eyes looked  90
like those of Tree Chief. I The child thought: "Bet who I will get me
first. He shall be my grandparent." Then I the old woman said:
"Let us bet! Go over there I and start to dig, and I'll go here and 11
I will also begin to dig. Whoever first gets down to him! shall take  95
him. If you take him first, you may kill him. I If I get him first,
he shall be I my grandson."  Wolf said: "Well."  Wolf thought: I
"The child is bad; I will kill him."  Then 11 the old woman and her 100
husband raced digging. Oh, I the man was digging fast! The woman
was not digging fast. I She nodded her head. Then the old woman
began to dig fast, I and her husband was not fast. The old woman
just went through  to the pit. She felt of the child II and pulled him 105
out. She pulled him away. Then the old man also | pushed his hand
through, but there was no child. He said: "Ya, I Imissed it." Then
both went out. The old woman looked I at the child. She thought:
"Long ago I saw Tree Chief. I His eyes were like those of this 1| child." 110
Then Wolf went back to his tent. He fitted up I his trap. When
the old woman brought back the child, I she washed him. She was
glad to have a grandson. I
(d) TREE CHIEF PROVIDES FOOD FOR HIS GRANDPARENTS
Then the child was almost grown up. He said to his grandmother: I
"Grandmother, is there no sinew? "  She said to him: "0 grandson! 1I there is none here."  The old man said to the child: "Where 1 115
should he get it from?" The old woman looked for it and found I a
small piece. She gave it to her grandchild, and the child made a
netted ring. I He held it outside on the point of a stick. He brought
it in, and it was loaded with birds.' I He took them off and held it
A bird smaller than a robin, yellow at the tips of the feathers, with a single feather on top of its head.

out again. He took it in, and again I1 it was loaded with birds. He 120
said to his grandmother: "Grandmother!" I The old woman looked,
and there was a pile of birds. I She was told: "Prepare them. Let
us eat." The old woman was glad. I
In the morning he said to his grandmother: "Is there no leg skin I
of a yearling buffalo calf?" The old woman said: "There isn't
any."  The old man said: 11 "Old woman, do you bring it, that there 125
may be some!" I The old woman looked for it. She saw some. She
said to him: I "Here it is. It is a little piece." The child said: I
"Give it, anyhow." The child made the netted ring. He took it
out. I He opened the door a little farther. He went there. 1I He said 130
to his grandmother: "Cover your head with your blanket." Then
he began to roll I the netted ring to the door. He said to the ring: |
"Surprise them a little; the old man does not like me." I Then the
netted ring rolled along there. The boy said: I "Go away, go away,
go away, grandmother! The game will hook you." II There was noise 135
of running, but the old woman and the I old man would not get up.
When he threw back his blanket, he saw the game I jumping into the
tent. It was about to hook them. Then the I boy threw his lance
and killed it. He went there.  He said to her: "Grandmother, cut
it up." The old woman arose, II and saw a yearling. She was glad. 1 140
Then she skinned it. He said to his grandmother: "Don't I spill the
guts. Put them behind in the tent, and also the hair." I She put the
coagulated blood inside. He said to her: " Grandmother, put it also
behind in the tent." I Then the old woman cut it up and dried the
meat. II In the evening they slept. Early next morning the boy 145
arose, and he said: "Grandmother, I'll eat pemmican." I The old
woman said: "There is no pemmican."  The I child said: "You put
it away. Look!" The old woman went there. I She looked at the
guts. They had become pemmican. II His grandmother took a piece, 150
and also the old man, I and they all ate pemmican. In the morning
the boy said: i "Grandmother, is there no edge piece of the skin of a
buffalo cow?"  She said: I "There is none." The old man said:
"There is some; give it to the child." I She looked and found it.
She said to her grandson: "There is a II small piece." He said to his 155
grandmother: "Anyway, give it to me." I She gave it to him. He
made a larger netted ring, I the same as before, and he made it in the
same way as the day before, when he killed I the yearling. That was
his blanket. On the same day the boy I killed a cow and made a
blanket for his grandmother. 11
Across the river from where the tent was there was the town 1 160
where Coyote was married. The youth said to I his grandmother:
"Grandmother, give me pemmican; I'll draw water." I His grandmother gave him pemmican. I The youth knew already that at the

her. He said to her: "Take it back home and eat it. Don't let
that man see it. I If your mother asks who owns this pemmican, say
to her, | 'The one who draws water all the time gave it to me.'" 1I
Then the girl started back. She was the daughter of the I chief 170
Golden Eagle. The youth also went back. |
In the morning he said to his grandmother: "Is there no leg part
of the skin I of a bull?" The old woman said: "There is none."
The old man said: I "There is some; give it to the child." She
found it |I and gave it to him. She said to him: "Here! It issmall." 175
He said: "Even though it is small, give it to me." He made a large
netted ring. I He worked his manitou power; and although the edge
of the skin was small, I it became a large netted ring. He did the
same way I as he had done with the yearling. Just as he had done
that, he killed the bull. II Then the old man also had a blanket. 180
There was a painting in the center of it. I When she had put the

brought it out the next day, it was tanned, I and there was a painting in the center of the blanket. Then the grandparents and the

water. I I'll eat it on my way." | She said to her grandson: "You
eat it too quickly." He said to her: "I give it to the water carrier." I
Then he went to draw water. When he came to the water, I1 the girl 190
also came. He gave it to her. He said to her: "Eat it. | If your
mother asks you who gave it to you,.then I say to her, 'That one
gave it to me himself who goes to the river to draw water.'"  He
said to her: I "Don't give any of it to the man, your I elder sister's

The people in that town were very hungry. There were no I buffa- 195
loes. Tree Chief had hidden them. i He was angry at Coyote.
Therefore he had hidden the buffaloes. He said to the girl: "Tomorrow prepare I my seat; I'll go to your tent." The girl went
back. 1[ When she entered the tent, she gave the pemmican to her 200
mother. ] Then she ate. Her father also ate, and I she gave some to
her elder sister, Coyote's wife, while I Coyote lay asleep. He felt
uneasy. Helooked sideways I at his wife. He said to her: "Itlooks
as though you were eating something." 11 His wife did not look at 205
him. Her mother said: "Who owns I this pemmican?" She said

Golden Eagle thought: I "Now I'll see who owns what I eat."

Golden Eagle went out, I took a feather of his body, and threw it up. II
There was a tree. Where he threw it, (the feather) became an 210
eagle. I He always used to make eagles, and therefore his name was |
Golden Eagle. He spoke, and said: "Here on the tree | a golden
eagle is sitting. Let all the children, youths, I big men, and old men,
shoot at it! Whoever kills it shall 11 marry my daughter, the one who 215
remains." Then they all I took their bows. The people of that town
went out. I It was a big town. There were many boys, youths, I men,
and old men, and all shot at it. Golden Eagle said: I "Every one
shall have one shot."  Then they all shot. 11 Coyote shot once. He 220
shot, shot. Then I they laughed at him. They all shot, but no one |
hit it. Tree Chief knew that they were shooting I at the golden
eagle. He was not told about it because he was small. They
thought | he would not be able to do it. He just discovered through
his manitou power what was happening. 1I He made a small bow and 225
a small arrow. He started. He went there. I He arrived, and all
the people were outside. I They saw the boy coming, shooting away
while he was coming along. I Then just from the edge where they
were he shot. I Only a few saw the boy. Coyote was still shooting, 11
shooting. Coyote just shot again. When I the child shot, they knew 230
that he had hit I the golden eagle. It fell down. Coyote saw it fall
down. | He ran after it. When it reached the ground, he took
hold of it. He I saw that it was not his arrow. Then he took out his
arrow and exchanged it (for Tree Chief's arrow). I] He began to run. 235
He had (the bird) on his arrow. He said:  F "Father-in-law, father-inlaw!"  He shouted. He said to his father-in-law: I "I killed the
golden eagle." One man said to Coyote: " Try to be sensible. Whatever may have happened, this is not it. I Look at it! It is a prairie
chicken you are carrying. There, that II boy has it on his arrow. 240
He shot it." Coyote looked at what he was carrying. I It was a
prairie chicken. Then they all laughed at what Coyote had done. |
He thought he would take Eagle's other | daughter, because he had
fooled Golden Eagle before. He thought he I ought to marry both
his daughters. Then all went into ]] the tent. They said: "The 245
boy I is too small to have a wife." But Golden Eagle thought: I
"Even if the boy is small, I'll take him to be I the husband of my
daughter." I
At night, when the people slept, Tree Chief's II grandmother came. 250
She carried the golden eagle. | His grandmother said to him: "Who
killedit?" Hesaid: "Idid." I She said to him: " What did you kill
it with?" He said to her: "With I my bow here."  His bow was

small. I] The old woman thought: "Now my grandson may leave me, 1 255
because Eagle Chief was not without high rank. I Maybe he did not
do it." I
In the evening he went to get water, and again he saw the girl.
He said to her: "To-morrow at noon I shall come." The girl knew |
that he had shot the golden eagle. II It was he who had given her 260
pemmican. Then she started again. I On the following day he said
tohisgrandmother: "I shall give you | the golden eagle that I brought
yesterday. This is what I won I by playing. I won a woman. I
shall go there." I The old woman said: "Whose daughter is she?"
The youth said: I1 "She is Golden Eagle's daughter."  The old woman 265
said: I "If he were not chief, I should not give you up." I The old
woman cried. Her grandsonsaid to her: "Don't I cry! I shall not
leave you." The old woman said: | "Do you want to carry meat
along?" The boy said: 11 "To-morrow there will be much meat in 270
that town. I I shall make it."  The old woman said: "It is well.
Your wife will come for meat. The eagle will eat I it." I
In the evening the boy started. 1I He went behind the tents. He 275
made himself look the way he used to be I when he was with his
mother. His clothing was fringed. I He had a shield and he had a
tomahawk. I He had a little hammer and he had a war bonnet, and I
on his head was a sparrow hawk. His saliva was |I shells. He had 280
everything that he used to have I when he was with his mother. He
started I for the town, and he was a large youth. i When he came
out of the prairie, he shouted, and the people in the town heard it. I
They said: "Well, Tree Chief arrives." 1] They looked at him, and 285
they saw him coming. Then I they went out. He arrived. He was
told: "Thereisthe i chief's tent."  On thedaybefore, I when heshot
the eagle, he was not recognized. Only the girl and I Golden Eagle
knew that he was the one who had I1 shot the golden eagle on the pre- 290
vious day. Then the girl I shook his bed. She prepared the seat
where her husband was to sit. Then he went there. He entered. |
His place was prepared. He sat down. i The girl had prepared the
place for Sparrow Hawk to sit down. II Coyote was sitting there.
Then there were two I friends who had each a sparrow hawk. After
some time he spat, I and his saliva turned into shells. I The Sparrow 295
Hawk screeched, flew down, and ate I the shells. Then Coyote was
angry. He was ashamed. 11

(f) TREE CHIEF PROVIDES FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE
At night, when Tree Chief slept, he knew | that the people in the 300
town were starving. In the morning he said i to his wife: "Tell your
father tolook at the fortune-telling place." I Then she started. In the
morning the woman said to her father: | "He says you shall look at
yourfortune-tellingplace." Then 11 GoldenEagle looked at hisfortune- 305
telling place. He saw many I tracks of buffalo cows. He went out
and shouted. Then I the youths said: "Make the buffalo fence
strong." Then I the buffalo fence was made strong. Tree Chief went
along. I There was a large prairie. He began to pile up the manure
of II buffaloes, much of the same kind. After he had piled it up, I he 310
shouted at it. He said to it: " Hu, hu; hu, ya!" Then I all the buffalo
dung arose and became buffalo cows. I Then he rounded them up.
Then he started. Just as soon as he arrived I at the buffalo fence, he
saw many buffaloes coming. 1I The people told one another: " The buffa- 315
loes are coming. Be careful! Don't I let them disperse!" The buffaloes
arrived. They did not disperse, and they all I went over the precipice.
They were piled up. Many buffaloes filled up I the buffalo drive.
Then all the people took them. I They said: "Take everything.
Take even' l the skin."  Then they were all taken up the hillside. 1 320
Tree Chief came up the hill. I He sat down, and all were taken.
Chief Golden Eagle I had taken the fat of the buffaloes. He saw his
son-in-law, I who did not go down. He remained sitting on top. Then
all the II fat buffaloes had been taken. (The chief) said to his daughter: 325
"Tree Chief is tired. I Therefore he did not come down. Here is
a fat cow. I Take it. It also has good hair. That shall be your
blanket." I When Tree Chief came back, one buffalo cow came along
behind the others. I It was old, thin, and full of sores. It alsoll
slid down from above. It stopped up there. It was so old that 330
it was not good to be eaten, I therefore it was not looked at. Tree
Chief knew | whathisfather-in-lawhadsaidwhenhe took I onefatcow.
Then he went down. He went to I the lean buffalo, the sore one.
He let it slide down. 1I His wife came, and he said to her: "Why did 335
you take that | buffalo? There are many people. They ought to take
what slides down. I Let us go and skin it!"  She went and I skinned
it. Then Coyote laughed I at them because theyskinned one sore one.
Coyote spoke, II and said to him: 'Why do you do that? That kind 340
is not eaten. | Leave this cow lying there. Eagle has taken I a fat
one with good hair on it for a blanket for your wife." I They did not

aside too, also the skin; I put the coagulated blood into it and put it
aside." Then ] the woman did as her husband told her. |
Coyote saw what his friend and his sister-in-law were doing, 11 and 390
he told his wife to do the same. She carried it I in her blanket.
When evening came, Coyote's wife did the sameI as Tree Chief's
wife was I doing. I
Early in the morning Tree Chief and his wife arose. 1| Then they 395
ate. He said to his wife: I "Where is the pemmican? I'lleat." She
said to him: "Is there any I pemmican?" He laughed, and said to
her: "You brought it in. ( There it is." His wife said to him: "Is
that pemmican? I Those were guts."  He said to her: "Bring it out
and look at it." I] Then the woman pulled it out slowly. It was 400
heavy. I She looked at it, and it had turned into pemmican. There
were no more I buffalo guts. Then it was eaten. He said to her:
"Pull out your blanket." I She said to him: "Is there one  There
was one, but it was all bloody." ] He said to her: "Pull it out and
look at it."  The woman took 1] the bloody blanket. It was no more 405
that way. I It had become a new one with beautiful stripes. He said
to his wife: I "Look also at the other things we put aside." The
woman looked | at the skin which she had put aside. It had become |
a tanned skin with a painting in the middle, although it had been
full of sores Ij with bad hair, for it had been an old I buffalo cow. 410
Its fur was very good. |
After Coyote had watched what his friend was doing, I he did the
same, but nothing happened. I His wife's blanket remained stiff, and
the skin that she had put aside I1 remained rawhide, and the stomach
which she had put aside I remained as before. It was buffalo dung.
His wife cried, I because he had given her trouble. Tree Chief said to
his sister-in-law: I "Don't cry! Put them back again." Then the
woman, the wife of Coyote, put back again her 11 own blanket, the
rawhide, and the guts, I but Golden Eagle did just the same as Tree
Chief. I He did the same to him. He was glad I when he saw what
his son-in-law had done, | but his other son-in-law made him
ashamed. II He was ashamed on account of what he had done. I
After a while, Tree Chief told his sister-in-law: I "Look again at 425
the things you have put aside. Eat I pemmican with the children."
The woman looked at it, and it had turned I into pemmican. Coyote
had not been able to do it. And there I1 were also two blankets.
She looked at them, and both were good. Then I Tree Chief finished 430
his good work. I

At night Coyote said to his wife: "Oh, ] tell your father to look at
his fortune-telling place." Coyote started. I Now, Coyote was going
to play. Early in the morning 1] Golden Eagle looked at his fortune- 435
telling place. There were no tracks. He came in again. I Coyote
went along. There was some manure. I He piled it up; and after
piling it up, he yelled I at the buffaloes; but the buffalo manure did
not move. He tried to drive the buffaloes, I but he could not move
them.   He ran back. 11 He went along, and came to the town. 440
He went up a hill, I and he said: "The buffaloes have dispersed." He
shouted I his words.' He said: "The bridegroom is staying with his
wife!" I He meant. Tree Chief by these words. (They | used to call
bridegrooms those who had not been married long.) 1| Then the people 445
of the town went down when Coyote had said this. I They laughed
at him, because the day before many buffaloes had been killed; I but
now they did not move. The people prepared the meat I and the
skins. Then Coyote entered his tent, and Tree Chief lay there.
Coyote said also 1| what Tree Chief had said before, when he spoke on 450
the hill. I Tree Chief arose. He said to Coyote: [ "What did you say?
Say it again. Don't you know what you did I when you pushed me
into the trap of Wolf?" I Then Tree Chief took a firebrand. I| He 455
wanted to kill Coyote. He might have killed him. Therefore I he
took up the firebrand. Then Coyote was struck. I He was struck
while he was running out. He was told: "We shall never meet
again. I If you want to die, come back to me." |
That is the end of the story of Tree Chief. II He would have been 460
the greatest one j if he had not fought with Coyote. |
(g) THE END OF THE WORLD
Now I'll finish the story of Tree I Chief's fight with Coyote. |
When Coyote and his friend fought, II Coyote was beaten away west- 465
ward. I Coyote was being beaten. Although we do not know I the
place where the sun goes down, there Coyote was left. I He was told:
"You shall stay here. Don't I go about any more through the whole
world. Later on, at the end of the world, II I'll see you again. I shall 470
go back that way I where the sun rises. There I shall stay. When |
the chief says that this world shall be no more, then I'll I arise. I'1l

come back. You, Coyote, will also I arise, and you shall come back.
In the middle of the world 11 we shall meet.  Then we shall shake 475
hands." I
This is the very last of the story of.what I the friends Tree Chief
and Coyote did I long ago, and what they will do at the end of the
world. I
65. RAVEN
Well, I'll tell you about Raven. I
(a) THE ORIGIN OF DEATH
There was a town. The chief spoke, and said: "Everybody shall
die twice." Everybody wished for what the chief said; | but Raven
did not want it because he eats 1I eyes. Since he was chief, his word  5
was taken. I
After some days the chief spoke, and said: "Let us kill [ Raven's
children!" They said: "Shoot at a grass figure, I and the girls shall
get fuel. Then you shall shoot [ Raven's son, and you shall chop a
tree down and make it fall on [I his daughter."  Now they shot at the  10
grass figure, and Raven's son was shot. I The girls chopped down a
tree; and when the tree was about I to fall, Raven's daughter was
thrown under it. I They talked, and said: "Raven's son has been
shot," I and they said: "A tree fell I] on Raven's daughter." Raven  15
said: "Now they shall die twice." I He was told: "You are a chief,
and already I you have spoken." |
(b) WHY THE ANT HAS A THIN WAIST
Then, when they were talking, Ant tightened his belt I in order to
bury the dead. He almost II cut himself in two, and was small after 20
that. I
(C) RAVEN HIDES THE GAME
Then Raven could not succeed. He had had two children. Then I
Raven was angry. He hid himself and hid all I the buffaloes. (Both)
were lost, I Raven and the game. All went on, but he was lost. 11 It 25
was not known where Raven had gone. It was known I that he had
done it. For a long time they were hungry. After a long time I
they all became thin. I
Raven thought: "Let me go to the town to see if I they are starving," Then he started. He transformed himself into a raven.
He flew 1I away and flew back to the town. He flew about above  30

some distance, lay down, | and lay on his back hungry. His stomach
was empty, and he lay there I just like dead. II
Raven staid there. He thought again: "I'll go back to the 40
town."  He transformed himself into a raven. He flew away and
flew to the town. He saw Beaver lying | a little ways off. He
thought: "Oh, Beaver is wise, | but he doesn't know where the buffaloes are." Since he had become 11 a raven, he thought: " Let me eat 45
Beaver's eyes." I He flew down. He sat down on Beaver's belly. I
Because he thought he was dead, he was not afraid. I Beaver took
him. Then Beaver said: "I caught Raven." [
All ran out to get Raven. 1I He almost got away from Beaver, 50
because Beaver was hungry and weak. | Raven was fat and strong.
Then the people arrived. I Raven was caught and taken to the
chief's I tent. They all went in. The tent was ballasted. [ It was a
big tent, and they were all around it. 11 Coyote climbed up to the top 55
of the tent. I Coyote was looking in through the smoke hole. Then
they spoke. | They said to Raven: "Now, tell us, what did you do
with I the game? The poor children are hungry. You have hidden
it." I Raven did not speak. He wept. II He cried, because he was to 60
die. They were not to kill him, because he was a chief, I because it
was a town. He wore around his neck the eyes of buffaloes. I They
took off his neckwear and ate' it. They told him: I " Quick, speak!"
Raven did not speak. He looked up, I and saw Coyote there in the
smoke hole. 1] He knew that Coyote was a coward. He thought: 65
"Now I I'll be saved." Raven said: "Which way I shall I put my
head?" He shouted. He saw Coyote, who was scared. I He thought:
"Now I shall not die." They said to him: " Quick, I speak!" He
shouted louder, and said: " Which way [I shall I put my head? " Then 70
Coyote flew up, and I Raven jumped out. He flew out. I He was
saved. Coyote was scolded. |
Raven flew straight up, and waslost to sight. I Magpie had cleareyes.
He said: " Qo, qo, qo! " II Coyote became angry. He tookdirt andthrew 75

Then his eyes began to water. They were filled with dirt. Therefore I they are this way. He said: "Raven flew back this way." I
Then at night they held a council. They said: " Who will II go the  80
way he flew back? " Then they said: " Jack Rabbit I and Hare."
On the following day the two youths started. I They went along.
There was a river there. The wind blew toward them, and they
took his scent. Then they started, going up the river. [ They saw
a tent. It was the tent of two old women. I[ They arrived there. 85
They did not know what it was. They saw many I tracks of buffaloes. They said to each other: "What shall we do?"  One said:
"We will work our supernatural powers."  One turned into a jack
rabbit.' I The other became a stone. They staid there. I One of
the old women went to draw water. She went to a water hole in
the ice. II There she saw a little dog near the water hole. I She did  90
not like it, and pushed it into the water hole. Then I the young dog
was cold. The old woman went back. The other old woman I also
went to draw water. She saw the pup there at the I water hole. It
was almost frozen to death. 1] She pitied it. It was thin. She took  95
it and started carrying it. I She went in, and said to her companion:
" Why did you I do that? "  She said to her: " It is poor; it will eat
bones. I They must all be starved. Therefore this pup came here." I
The other old woman went to get an anvil stone to pound II.dried 100
meat. She went along, and there was a good stone. I She started
to carry it. She did not know that she had thrown into the water
the one young man, I and that the other one was a stone. She carried
it in. Then I the two youths worked their manitou powers. They
staid there in the tent of the old women,   They staid there
several days. 1I Then the two youths ate. The old women did not 105
know it. I The two slept together during the night. On the following morning I the one was again a dog, and the other was a stone. I
The two youths saw what happened | when the buffaloes came to that
tent every night. II There was a bladder hanging by the door, I and 110
there was a bunch of claws hanging there. When [ the buffaloes came
back, they shook the bladder [ and the claws. [
At night they said to each other: "Let us start back to the town II
wherethey are hungry! Let ustakeback thebuffaloes!" Then I they 115
started. They saw a great number of buffaloes. One [ of theyouths
burst the bladder with a stick; the other I took the bunch of claws.
Then the one started. That one was I first. Then the other one
started. There at the source of the river, 1 'where the buffaloes were, 120
1 Evidently an error, for later on he is a pup.

Qwa, qwa, Jack Rabbit! Bring the game!" I
The two old women saw the game going by. I They said to each
other: "The game is passing along."  The one shook 1| the bladder. 125
It made no noise. It had burst. I The other one went to get the
claws. They were not there. She looked for I the dog. She thought
she would send it in pursuit to get them back. I It was not there.
Then she knew that he was singing, and that he was the one. She
said: | "Why did you take that little dog? He has done it. He has
stolen 11 our game. I knew by his eyes that he was Jack Rabbit. 1 130
Therefore I put him into the water, and you brought him in." I
Then the two old women took hammers, and they went I to the
trail of the game in the snow. They stood on each side, ready to
strike with their hammers. I They thought they would strike Jack 11
Rabbit. 1                                                  135
One scabby bull was left behind. The youth came back, I and saw
the two women ready to strike him. I Then he ran after the scabby
bull. He transformed himself into a | jack rabbit. He held on with
his teeth to the bull's testicles, and was II hanging down between his 140
legs. One of the old women struck it I and flattened out one leg (of
the scabby bull). The other old woman struck him | on the other leg
and made it flat. Then I all the parfliches in the tent began
to roll out; and | because the fat and marrow began to roll, the other
old woman ran after it. 1| She caught it, and it dragged her along. 1 145
The other one ran after it, and the fat and marrow were rolling this
way. She took it, I and it dragged her along. They could not hold
it. I They fell down crying.
Now I have told how Raven stole the game. [

he would I kill her. Then she thought thus, she was told: "I'll eat I|
huckleberries." Then she gave them to him. In the evening | she 15
started back. She loved her husband, Chicken Hawk. I There were
no huckleberries which Chicken Hawk was to eat. Even though she
had picked until the evening, I she had done badly. Then she went
back to her tent, | and arrived when it was very dark. When she
arrived, Chicken Hawk 1I was already there. She gave it to him. She 20
was afraid. She said to him: "I did not I get many huckleberries. I
felt ill. I did not pick berries. I I have been lying down all day."
When Grouse was going back, I she saw the bird grouse, who was I her
manitou. Therefore she was called Grouse. She knocked it down. 11
She took it, and at night she took a piece of it into her mouth. I She 25
said: "I have a headache; I will not eat." I She lay down. She
groaned. After a little while l she got up again. She vomited.
She vomited yellow water. I That was the bird that she had swallowed. 11 She was not sick at all. She did so because she was afraid 30
of I her husband, whom she deceived. I
In the, morning Chicken Hawk went out hunting. Grouse said:
"Even I though I am not feeling well, I'll go to pick berries. Yesterday I did badly picking huckleberries." Grouse left, and 1I she did the 35
same with the Water Monster. She did also the same, and I picked
berries for Chicken Hawk. When she arrived at the house, she
groaned still more. I Early the next day Grouse said: | "Although I
am sick, I'll go and pick berries. I If I should happen to die, you
would not eat any more of the fruit that I pick." II Then Grouse 40
started again. I
Chicken Hawk felt uneasy. He thought: "Maybe l my wife is not
sick. I'll go there I where she is picking berries." Chicken Hawk
started. He came to I the place where his wife was. She was singing. He thought 11 he knew that she was not sick. He stood there. 45
When it was almost I evening, Grouse started for the lake. I Shesaid:
"I'll give something to eat to my husband the Water Monster." I
Chicken Hawk looked on, (and saw) his wife going and singing. I She
went to the shore. He saw the Water Monster coming out of the
water. I 'Grouse went there. She carried the huckleberries. | When 50
the Water Monster came ashore, he opened his mouth, and she emptied I the huckleberries into his mouth. Then Grouse sat down. I The
Water Monster was coming ashore. Then Grouse shouted, [ and she
and the Water Monster laughed and made noise. 11 When it was almost 55
evening, the Water Monster went back into the water. | Then Grouse
started for home. She sang. She said: I "It is getting evening,

and I have done badly picking I huckleberries for my husband
Chicken Hawk." I
Then Chicken Itawk was angry. He went back. Chicken Hawk
thought: 11" I'll kill the Water Monster. He is bad. He kills people. 1 60
He wants to kill me doing this to my wife."  Then I he went back
He arrived at home. After a while, I when it was dark, he heard his
wife groaning on the trail. I He knew that she was not sick. Grouse
came in. I| Her head was tied up. She gave huckleberries to her 65
husband, | and said to him: "I was still more sick, I and the berries
are bad." Chicken Hawk did not eat the huckleberries. { He put
them back, and said to his wife: "I'll not eat them. I The leaves
and twigs are bad. If you want It me to eat them, wash them. Then  70
I'll eat them." Grouse lay down. | She said: " I will not wash them.
I am very ill. I I will lie down." Then, after she had slept, in the
morning I Grouse said: "I'll pick berries again. There are many I
huckleberries. I like to do it." II
Chicken Hawk said: "Take care!"  Chicken Hawk did not say 1 75
anything else. Then it was said that Grouse I and the Water Monster
should die. Grouse started. Chicken Hawk took | his two arrows,
and he worked his manitou power over his arrows. I The Water Monster is skillful. Therefore Chicken Hawk worked his manitou power II
over his arrow, to shoot the Water Monster with it. Then he started. I 80
When he arrived where she was, he heard Grouse singing along. |
Then he went there. The Water Monster also came ashore. | Then
they met on shore. He arrived there. They did not see him I when
he came there. The Water Monster had already eaten the huckleberries I| which Grouse had picked. Chicken Hawk arrived. He said  85
to him: "0 friend!" I The Water Monster looked at him, and at
once he shot at him. The Water Monster said: I "I'll swallow him."
Chicken Hawk was not afraid of him. The Water Monster was hit. I
Then he went towards the water. Grouse went to I Chicken Hawk,
and said to him: "My husband Chicken Hawk, I love you." 11 Chicken  90
Hawk said: "I will not take pity on you. I You brought me into
trouble." Grouse was shot and I was killed. There where Grouse lay
a bird flew up. I Chicken Hawk said: "You shall be grouse. I You
shall be eaten." I|
Then Chicken Hawk started. When the Water Monster sank     95
down I in the water in the middle of the lake, he lay down, I for he was
wounded in the belly. After a while he died. He drank I the whole
lake. He drank all the rivers and all I the creeks and little lakes.
There was no more water. 11 For several days the people looked for 100

back the water. I If I am- clever, we shall drink again, but | it is dangerous. The Water Monster may make war on me in another way." 11
Chicken Hawk sang, then he went along to the place where I the 105
Water Monster lay. Chicken Hawk pulled his arrow | out of the
wound of the Water Monster. Then the water came flowing out, and |
the people drank. They were all saved. Then i the people of the
town went back to the shore. 11
Now, it was seen that the water was rising. They went farther 110

still farther away from the shore, and again the water reached there. |
They climbed the mountains. The water rose, | rose, rose. They
went to the top of a mountain. I It was still rising, and it seemed
that in a little time all the land would be gone. II Then Chicken Hawk 115
sang in the same way. The chicken hawk was I his manitou; that
is, the bird chicken hawk. Therefore he was called Chicken Hawk. I
He opened his sacred bundle (which contained) the tail of the bird
chicken hawk. | He placed it upright, and said to the people:
"Watch this I tail. If the water passes the three stripes of the tail, 11
then the world will come to an end. We shall all be drowned. I The 120
Water Monster will kill us all. If I am clever, I the water will go
-down, and we shall be saved." Then they watched I the tail that
Chicken Hawk had put up. Chicken Hawk sang. I Then the water
reached the first stripe. II The water also passed the second stripe. 125
Chicken Hawk was singing, I and the water also reached the third
stripe. Then it was seen I that the water ceased to rise. They said
to Chicken Hawk that it had ceased to rise. He said: I "Watch it!"
Chicken Hawk was singing. He was told: I "The water is going
down again."  Then he said: "Now we shall not die."  He sang. II
Then the water went down. Then they all went down. I They came 130
down to the foot of the mountain. Then the water I reached back to
its own place, and everybody was glad. I
Now I have told you what Chicken Hawk and the Water Monster I
did in olden times. I

There was a town, and a man was named Wolf. Ile was married [
to a woman in another camp. Her name was Doe. II When his wife 5
made moccasins for him, they were bad. When she made moccasins
for her elder brothers, ] they were good. Wolf was angry. He left his
wife. I He went back to his town. When he arrived, he said: "Let
us start for | my wife's town. Let us fight them!" Then I they
started. When they arrived, his brother-in-law knew it. Ile had

The two-year-old Buck sang. He said to his wife: I "The Wolves
are mad at us."  He dug a hole, I and let his wife and his son go in.
Then I the many warriors arrived where the young Buck was sitting. II
Because he was working his manitou power, he had become a deer, 1 15
and he became what his name was. He went up a mountain. I He
went up there to the top. Wolf I killed all the people. He looked
for his brother-in-law. Where those who had been killed were piled
up, I he did not see his brother-in-law. He knew that he had manitou
power. [I He thought: "I shall not be able to kill him."  He went 1 20
to his seat and sang. Then he became a wolf. I He looked; and
because he was working his manitou power, he saw 1 the tracks of his
brother-in-law. Then he went that way. I He looked, and saw him
on top of a mountain. |I His brother-in-law was standing there, facing 25
this way. Wolf went up. Then the one I who had become a young
buck saw him. Wolf started to go up to him. I He just began to go up;
and when Wolf arrived, there was another high mountain. I He went
down, and went up toward the top. I When Wolf was going down, at
the place where his brother-in-law had been standing, there were his
tracks. II He saw another high mountain on the other side, and he 30
was standing on top. I Again Wolf went up. The Buck saw I the
Wolf starting, and went down to a river. I He thought: "I'll go to my
'father's mother, Fish." 1 Fish's I tent was on the other side of the
river. When Wolf stepped 11 down to the place where his brother-in- 35

and said: "Don't I move!" Buck thought: "I thought he i would
do something for me, therefore I came in." There was just one
mitten I which Fish threw on him. Buck was big, | and his legs
stuck out. Then he saw Wolf come in. 11
Buck thought he would be seen by Wolf, | and did not turn 60
his eyes from those of Wolf, who did not see him. Now Wolf I
retransformed himself into a man. When he was about to enter the
tent | of Fish, he said to him: "Didn't you see Buck?" I He did
not look at him. He did the same as he had done with Buck. II He did 65
the same. (Wolf) was coaxing him. After a while Fish spoke, I and
said to him: "Your talk is bad.   He is your brother-in-law.
You loved each other. Why are you angry at him? " Fish said:
"Did Buck transform himself into game? "  Wolf said: I "Yes, he
transformed himself."  Fish said: "Why should he 11 come into my 70
tent if he is a deer? If he should come I into my tent, he would
become a man. Go out. Maybe I he went into the water. Game
does that."  Then Wolf went out. I Fish made a figure of grass.
He hurriedly threw it out of the smoke hole. I The figure became
a deer, which stood there on the other side of the water. I1 When 75
Wolf went out, he saw i Buck standing in the water on the other side.
Wolf went in again, I and said to Fish: "Give me a canoe. I I see
a deer on the other side." Fish said: "You I said you became a
Wolf, and Buck became 11 a deer. Later on, when a wolf runs after a 80
deer and it goes into the water I of a river, then a wolf also will swim
across." I Wolf said: "Is that so? "  Wolf went out. |
He transformed himself into a wolf. He became one. Then he
swam across. I Fish had told a lie. It was not a deer standing in
the water; 11 it was grass that he had made into a deer. It was not 85
a deer I that was standing in the'water; it was grass. When Wolf
had gone out again, I Buck arose, and said to Fish: I "Take me
across, so that I may kill him, for he killed all my relatives." I
Then Fish arose, took his blanket, li and put it on him. He took his 90
belt and took his hat. He took | his mittens. Buck said: "Hurry
up! I He is about to swim across."  Fish said: "He is still here."
Then he went out and launched his canoe. [ He did not hurry. The
Wolf had almost gotten across. 1] Then Fish and Buck went aboard. 1 95
Fish took his paddle, put it into the water, and pushed with it. He
almost I caught up with Wolf. Then he put the paddle in on the
other side. He paddled, [ and caught up with Wolf. Then Buck

was about to shoot I Wolf, who did not see him. He touched his
canoe, 11 and it made a little noise. Wolf heard the canoe. | He looked 100
at it, and Buck was standing in the water, | about to shoot him.
Wolf said to him: "0 brother-in-law! I love you. I Don't kill me!"
Buck said: | "I shall not take pity on you, for you have killed all
my relatives." 11 The Wolf was shot and killed. Fish said: I "Go 105
back to your wife. Your son is poor." I
Now I have told all that happened in olden times. |
68. SKUNK
Well, I'll tell you what happened, what the brothers I Skunk and
Fisher did long ago.
Skunk and his brother lived in a tent. Fisher was his younger
brother. I There also was the tent of Frog and her granddaughters,
Chipmunk and 1 Big Chipmunk. 1                               5
Chipmunk was hungry for meat, and said: "Haom, I haom!" HIer
grandmother said to her: "0 granddaughter, granddaughter! I what
do you mean?" Chipmunk said: "I am hungry." | Her grandmother
said to her: "Take whatever you hunger for." II Chipmunk said: 10
"I am hungry for meat." I Her grandmother said to her: "Take a
little piece of dried meat. Eat it." I Chipmunk did not take it.
She was told: "Do you want fresh meat?" [ She replied: "Yes."
Then her grandmother, Frog, said to her: "Go to | Fisher. He shall
be your husband. Don't look at 1] Skunk. He is bad. Only Fisher 15
shall be your husband. I Fisher never is hungry. He is a skillful
hunter." |
Then the sisters Chipmunk and Big Chipmunk started. I Their
grandmother said to them: "When you get there, stay at a distance.
After a while, I in the evening you will see Fisher coming back. Then II
you may go near."  When the sisters arrived (at the tent), I they  20
staid at a little distance. Sokunk knew already I that the two girls,
were coming.  He had manitou power; therefore Ihe knew that
they were there. He was always pounding bones. He worked I his
manitou power. He took his younger brother's blanket, put it on,
and went out, 11 and his manitou pounded bones. Chipmunk said: 1 25
"Let us go near! There is Fisher. | Tie is at home." She was told
by her elder sister: "That is not Fisher I who came out, it is Skunk."
Chipmunk said: I "Where Fisher came out, there is always the noise
of Skunk pounding (bones) II inside." She was told by her elder sister: 30
"It is not Skunk who I makes the noise. Skunk's manitou does it."
After a while I Chipmunk insisted. Then her elder sister said:
"Well, I let us go, but do not feel badly about it if it is not Fisher. I

You urge me very much. Our grandmother said after a while, in
the evening, 11 when Fisher comes home, then we should go there." | 3
Then they started. When they arrived, they entered, and saw {
Skunk alone, nobody else. Skunk gave them meat. | Then they ate.
He said: I "Your grandmother wants me to marry you." Skunk
prepared a place in the rear of the tent. 1[ He said to them: "Stay 40
here." Then the sisters I went to the rear of the tent and staid
there. Skunk was I pounding dried meat all the time. l
ThenFisher came home. He said to his elder brother: "Go I and get
some water. I want to drink." He threw his drinking horn to him. 11
Fisher's water was far away. Skunk thought: I "Fisher might take 45
the girls." Then he arose. | Skunk took dried meat and threw it
backward to I the sisters. Skunk said: "Divide-de-de-de it." I When
he was almost going out, he said: "Don't move-ve-ve-ve!" 1" Then 50
Skunk started.  He thought: "Fisher's water is far away.  I
shall go to my water." Then he arrived there I and dipped it up.
Skunk started to run. He thought: "I I want to get back quickly.
He might take those girls." I He came back and gave the water to
his younger brother. Fisher took it, I and knew that it was Skunk's 55
water. Therefore he threw it back. | Skunk was told: "This is not
my water, | it is your water."  He was given another horn, i and
was told: "Draw some of my water."  Skunk started. | He just
dipped up the water and came back. He came back quickly, |I and 60
spilled it while running. Now there remain many little lakes, the
result of | what Skunk spilled while walking. Then he came home
and gave | the water to his brother. I
After Fisher had drunk, he said to Skunk: " Go and get my game." I
Fisher had known while he was away that the two girls had arrived, II
and that they wanted him, and that Skunk had already taken them. 65

He painted the entrails of the game red. These entrails I are called

When he arose, I the tump line broke. Then Skunk said: "Oh, I I
broke my brother's tump line!" Then it became cold. |I
When Skunk started, Fisher said: "Now I come out! Why did you  80
come here early? Later on, l when I came back, then you ought to
have come. Now eat meat! After you have eaten, we will move
away." Then the sisters ate | meat. 11
When they had eaten, they were told: " Now let us move! Skunk  85
is bad. I He has manitou power. He will kill us all." Fisher said: I
"There in the corner of the tent are all his rotten bones. Take
them all out." I Then the sisters took out Skunk's I bones. I
Fisher said: "Where shall we go? Skunk knows the place where 90
my tent is." | Chipmunk said: "Let us go to my tent!" I Then
they started. They entered; but Fisher could not I go in, for it was
too small. Then Big Chipmunk said: "Let us go | to my tent!"
When they arrived, they went in, but Fisher could not go 11 in. Fisher 95
said: "Then let us go to my tent, I although Skunk knows the place
of my tent!" | Then Fisher worked his manitou power, and two trees
stood there. He transformed himself, I and became a real fisher. He
transformed one I of his wives, and she became a real big chipmunk; l
and he transformed his other wife, and she became | a real chipmunk. 100
Then they climbed one of the trees. I
They staid there. Then Skunk, when there was a wind storm, I
which Fisher had made, and therefore it was cold, thought his i elder
brother would cause him to freeze to death. Then Skunk was cold. 11
He left his tump line at the door. He did not know that it was 105

dark, he left it. He went on. When he came back, I he knew that
they had moved camp. There was no fire. Then I he cried. He
thought: "I'll die, because it is cold." [I Skunk said: (?) "Chief, 110
chief!"1 I He looked for his rotten bones. They were all gone.
Then he saw I that there was one rotten bone in a hole. He went in.
He was glad. I He thought: "Now I am saved." I He staid there
that night. Early in the morning he was heard talking. IJ Then the 115
sisters were asked: "Big Chipmunk, did you take out all I his rotten
bones?" Big Chipmunk said: "I took them all." I Chipmunk said:
"There is one bone that I did not take." Then Fisher said: I "Then
Skunk will kill us all. He is bad. I That rotton bone is his manitou.
Now he can not die. II He will make war on us." 1           120

Then the sisters went out again. They sang. I They worked their
manitou power, and the size of Big Chipmunk's hole I was almost the
size of Skunk. The stones squeezed him all over. Then I Big Chipmunk and her sister went back to where Fisher lay. [1
When they got there, they restored him to life; and when Fisher 170
arose, I he saw his wives. He said to them: "Where is | Skunk?"
They said to him: "He is in a bole in the mountain." I He said to
them: "Let us go to a far-away country. I Skunk is bad. No matter
how strong the stones I[ you made, he will break them, he will come out 175
again." Then I Fisher and his wives started and left the country. I
Skunkwas asleep. He woke up, and knew I that his wives hurt him.
He said: "Move away a little! I You hurt me!"  Theydid not move;
and 1| he said again: "Move away a little!"  He pushed them, | and 180
he noticed that (what he touched) was hard. Then he moved, I and
everything was tight on his body. He was in a hole in the rock. It
was all I around him on each side of his body and on top of his body. I
He could not move. Then he cried. 1| Hethought: "Imustdie." He 185
knew that he even | used to break rocks. Then he sent out his fluid.
He went on sending out his fluid, I sending out his fluid, sending out
his fluid. After he had sent out his fluid for some time, I he could
move a leg. He went on sending out his fluid, and | he could move
all around. For a long time he sent out his fluid, and then the space
was large. II He could not see the daylight. He thought: "Let me I lie 190
the other way," and he turned the other way. Then he sent out his
fluid again. I After some time he saw a little hole. The rocks opened. I
He said: "Oh, it looks like a star!" I He sent his fluid again. Then
the hole was larger. Now 11 he was tired sending out his fluid. He 195
thought: "Now let me see ] how large the hole is." He took out his
musk bag and put it on the end of I his bow. He stuck it out. ]
Raven was going along at this time. He saw what Skunk was
doing. I He stood there outside; and when Skunk put out his musk
bag I1 here in front of Raven, he passed it in front of him. I He did not 200
look at it. After some time Skunk took his musk bag in again. ] He
smelled of it, and said: "It might smell like the eye of Raven. I
Maybe he is coming this way. He is one who is always going about."
(Raven) had not looked at it, I because he knew that (Skunk) would
smell of it. Therefore II he had not looked at it. (Skunk) put it out 205
again. Skunk sang, I and said:
" ap ho he ha! hp ho he ha hapoeha   ho he ha!" i

Raven transformed himself into a raven. He became a real raven. |
He took hold of Skunk's musk bag with his bill. Then he flew away, [I
because he had become a real raven, therefore he could fly. I Skunk 210
noticed the flapping of the wings of Raven, and said: | "Oh!" He
pulled in his bow quickly. His musk bag was gone. | Then he cried,
and said: "()... chief, I chief!" for hispower II had beentaken 215
away from him; therefore he cried. He said (to himself): I "You
always make too much noise about your ears. Now, listen whether I
the sky will make noise!" Then Skunk listened. I He noticed that
Raven went right up. I Then it came down making a noise. Then
the noise stopped. II He said: "There, farther along, I walk about. 220
Here, on this side, | went down the noise from the sky." Skunk was
lying there. He took I his knife and cut off his leg. He pushed it
out. I Because the hole was small, he could not get out. Therefore
he did so. He cut off | his leg. He pushed it out. He also cut off
the other one and II pushed it out. He cut off his arm and put it out, 225
too. | Now there was. one arm left. He cut it off, and it rolled out.
Then I all his limbs were gone. He sang, and said:
" Let my back roll out,
Let my back roll out." It
Then his back rolled out. Then he rolled out. I He rolled himself 230
on his one arm. He took I the other one and stuck it on. He took
his leg, and he | stuck on both of them. Then Skunk arose.
Then | Skunk stood up. He was bad. He had no entrails. 1] Then he 235
went and took leaves and put them in. Then he was almost good. I
He started to the place where Raven had flown, there across
the mountains.' I He went along. He went across the mountains,
and he went along the prairie. [ Far away he came to a town.
When Raven had arrived, I he had transformed himself into a man.
Then he said: I " I have brought with me Skunk's musk bag." Then 240
they were all I glad. They said: "Now Skunk will I no longer kill
everything. He has no musk bag." Then I theyplayed with it. They
played with it for a long time. ] Then Skunk came. A man was
seen coming along. He was told: II "Who are you?"  Skunk said: 245
"I come from that prairie ] over there. I am named I Coming-fromthe-Prairie- far-away-with -'Head-washed-with-White-Clay-carryingmy-Bow-Sideways." He was told: "Over there is the, tent I of the
chief. His name is Raven. He just came I to this town and brought
Skunk's musk bag. Now, II there is also a chief named Grizzly 250
Bear." There were two chiefs I in this town. Skunk went to Raven's

tent. I Raven brought out the musk bag. He worked over it, | and
it became a pup. Skunk did not go in. I The pup was tied.up at the
doorway. It went to him 1I and was glad. He said: "What did they 255
do to me, Tsot?" It knew him; I therefore it did so. But Raven
did not know that it was he. I Then Skunk sat down. He was given
food. Then I he ate. The food was bad, for there was nothing I in
him. He did not eat much. He did not eat more, because his insides were bad, I1 because he was dry inside. He was told by Grizzly 260
Bear: "You should go on." He arose. Skunk went out, and
where | he stood up, there -as meat. A child said: I "There lies
some meat." Raven said: "Don't I eat it. He dropped it from
his mouth. Children must not eat it. I'll 11 eat it myself." Skunk 265
entered Grizzly Bear's tent and I was given food. Here again he
could not eat much. When he stopped, | he went out; and there
was meat again where he stood up, | and Grizzly Bear himself ate it.
It was what Skunk had eaten. I Because he had no belly, when he
ate, 11 it went right through him. I                     270
Then, when it was about evening, Raven went out. I He said: "Come
out and play! I You have a toy." Then they all went out. Then
they brought out the pup. A little distance away they put it down. I
Then they kicked it. It ran, and they ran after' it. I When they 275
caught up with it, they kicked it. Then Skunk had pity I on his
musk bag. When it saw him, it almost I ran up to him. Then he
nodded his head the other way. Skunk thought: I "I am thirsty.
It might hurt me. Later on, to-morrow, 11 I'll take it back." At 280
night they stopped playing.. Then I skunk went to the river. He
jumped in and soaked himself. I In the morning and all day he
soaked himself. When the sun was going down, I they played again.
He thought: "I'll take back I my musk bag." They went on playing. Then Skunk 1] sat down a little ways off. He thought: I "It 285
might hurt me." They chased it toward him, and it went there. I
Then it turned back and came back. Then he nodded his head to
it, | and it came running this way. It came, and they could not
catch up with it. Then I Skunk turned himself toward it, and his
musk bag went to him. 11 It got into him again and threw him down. 290
Skunk got up. | They said to one another: "Don't look at him, for
it is Skunk. I He himself took back his musk bag." Their toy was
gone. I
Now I have told what Skunk and his brother did. |

69. FROG AND ANTELOPE1
Well, I'll tell you how, long ago, I Frog won over Antelope. I
There was a town. It was named Fish Hawk Nest.2 I Antelope
was chief. Antelope runs fast. Even [| the best runners were beaten  5
by Antelope. He was a manitou, and won over everybody. I There
was a town of Frogs. Then Chief I Frog thought: "I'll cheat Antelope."  He said to I his tribe: "Let us play with Antelope!"  They
said to him: I "What shall we do with Antelope? He runs fast."
He said to them: 11 "We shall go, all of us. We shall play with him." 10
Then I he told his people what to do. All the Frogs said: I "Well,
your thoughts are good." That chief said: "I'll go alone. Later
on, if I he agrees, to-morrow we shall-go." The Frog said: I "It is 15
well." Then he started. When he arrived at Antelope's (tent), I
Antelope said. to Frog: "Why do you come to my tent?" I Frog said:
"I come here to see if you are not afraid to run a race with me." I
Antelope laughed. He thought: I "Even if he runs fast, I can easily
do (leave behind) what Frog says." Frog was told: 11 "If you agree, 20
my property shall be your property. I You may give it to me."
Frog said: "Go; I I am glad. I'll take yoT property."  Then they
laughed at him I because he could not do (leave) what Antelope said.
Frog said: I "To-morrow just at noon I'll come, 1I accompanied by my 25
tribe.." Then Frog started. When he came home, I he said to his
tribe: "Now we will cheat Antelope I and his children." On the following morning the Frogs started, all of them. I There were many.
The women went along with the men Frogs. When they almost I came
to the town, the chief Frog said: [I "Before any one comes out, go and 30
lie down J on the trail they go. Just at that distance jump! I You
shall be that far apart." Then the Frogs went; to the starting
place, and all of them lay down I on the way they were to run.ll
They lay down up to the point where the track turned. When this 35
was all done, others went | to the town. They said: "The Frogs I
have come to play with us." Then all of them went out. [ They went
to the starting place. Then I the Frogs bet their property. All
their clothing was blue. II Then they bet with them. They staked 40
much, I because they thought the Frogs would be beaten. They
thought I they themselves would win. Thus they spoke among them

selves. Then Antelope stood up. | He laughed at his enemy. Frog
was lying there. Then he looked I-at Antelope. They said: "Now
start!"  Then Frog 1I jumped up. Antelope laughed. I His enemy 45
looked funny to him. (Antelope) did not run fast I when Frog gave
his first jump. Then another Frog lay there and I jumped up, and
all the Frogs did so. Then I Antelope did not go very fast. He had
not gone far when he was left behind. 1I Then Antelope ran more 50
quickly. He was left far behind. I He ran fast; but even when he
ran fast, the Frogs I were ahead of him. Then he arrived at the
turning place; I and when he got there, the Frogs lay down in the
opposite direction. Then i Antelope turned back, but the Frogs
were always ahead of him. I| Then Antelope tried hard. He knew 1 55
that he would be beaten. Antelope was not yet near the starting
point | when Frog arrived. Then all laughed; but I the people were
sick at heart, because Frog had won. Frog was looked at. I He was
not out of breath, because he had just given one jump 11 and then had 60
not moved any more. He just jumped back from there. I Therefore
he was not out of breath, but Antelope was puffing. I He lay on his
back, and said: I "You beat me, Frog." Then Frog took what he
had won. I He went back, and those who lay down did not move. |
In the evening they went back, and it was heard by all that I Frog 65
had beaten Antelope. I
Now I have told how Frog beat | Antelope in olden times.
70. THE STAR HUSBAND
Well, I'll tell a story of how a girl was married I to a star. I
The people of olden times lived in a tent. Two girls went out. |
When they were about to go to sleep, one of them looked up.
She saw II many stars. She saw a small one, and said: I "That is a 5
nice little star [hanging] there. I'll marry him." Then I the two
girls laughed when she said so. They went in again. I After they
had slept, early in the morning she woke up. There was talking, I
and she knew that those were not the voices of her parents. She
arose, and she saw I1 that she did not know the people. She was sit- 10
ting down next to an old man. I She knew that she was married
to him. She saw many other I young men. She thought: "When
there are many I youths, why don't they marry me? My husband is
old." I He said to her: " Here I am! The other II night you said to me, 15
'You little nice one! Marry me.' I Now I have taken you." She looked

stars were the old ones. Then the girl I cried when she saw that she
had [left] been taken away from her country. She staid there. 11
The star women were digging roots. The girl went along with them. I 20
She was told: "Don't break the ground where I there is a tree."
The girl thought: "What do I the stars mean?" There was a tree,
and she dug up I the ground. The ground was just thin. She thought
she would look, 11 and down below she saw this world. She recog- 25
nized I her relatives walking about. Then she cried. | She made something, and tied herself to it, and let herself down. I Then she met
her relatives. They said to her: "Where did you go? I We lost
you." She said: "When I said 11 I would marry the little star, then 30
after I had slept, i when I woke up, I saw a star coming down for me. |
I married the star. That little one was an I old man. The large
stars were young people." I Then she told what she had done and
how she had come down.. I The Star noticed that the girl was not 35
coming back. He looked for her. She had gone down again. I At
night they slept. The next morning when they got up, ] it was
noticed that the girl would not rise. They looked at her for a long
time. | Then it became known that she was dead. She was killed
by the Star I whom she had left. He struck her down. 1

71. LITTLE SUN
Well, I'll tell you about Little Sun.
There was a town, Chicken Hawk Nest. The chief said: "I'll I go
out to fight. Who among the young men can run fast?" i Little
Sun said: "I'll start." 'It was. already |I noontime, but he did not 5
start. They thought he would start. I When the sun was nearly
setting, they began to play ball. I When they had finished, Little Sun
went there. They thought he would I not get there, for it was far.
The place where he was to go was called I Kqawakmituk ([?] River).
There was a town at Kqawakmituk. 1| When the sun was setting, 10
they played football. The game was going on, I and Little Sun was
seen going along dragging his blanket. I They thought: "He must
have started from Fish Hawk -Nest." I He did not look as though he
were strong. He was small. They did not know that he was a fast
runner. I They said to him: "There is the tent of the chief." The
name of this chief was I| Not-sitting-down-Long. He went in. Then 15
they all went in I to hear the news. The chief from whom I Little
Sun came was called Crazy Old Woman. I

Then they filled the pipe for Chief Not-sitting-down-Long. I The
Chief, said: "Now speak! Why did you come?" 1] Little Sun said: 20
"The chief made a request I that some one should go on the warpath.,obody wanted to come, but I came.' I The chief was seated. He
said: "After how many days- shall the warriors start?" Little Sun
said: "He spoke this morning, and said, 'For three days 11 work on 25
arrow wood and bow staves. Put feathers on your arrows. | Then,
when everything is done, on the fourth day they shall start."' I
They said to Little Sun: "When did you start?"  He said: "This
evening." Then it was known that he was a runner. I They said
to him: "It shall be so. In three days they 11 also shall start. They 30
will all be ready: I On the fourth day they will not go far and stop. I
On the fifth day they will meet on Low Hills." I
It was dark, and Little Sun staid over night. He staid there
in the morning. | At noon Little Sun was not ready to go. 11 At sun- 35
set he started back, dragging his blanket. I They began to peel their
arrow wood. In the town Fish Hawk Nest I they played ball in the
evening. Just when they had finished their game, I Little Sun was
seen. He came dragging his blanket. I He entered the tent of the
chief. They assembled, 11 and they were going to listen to what the 40
chief would say. He said: "Yesterday after I started, I reached
there just after the game was over." I He was asked: "How high
was the sun when you got there?"  He said: I "I just said so." He
was told: "They were playing ball t when you started."  He said:
"Why, at the place to which I went II they had just finished their game 45
when I arrived."  Then it was known I that he was a runner: He
was told: "What did the chief say?" I He said: "He will do just as
you said. I Four days from to-day I you will meet at Low Hills. The
chief will not go, I[ but his son will go. Now I have told the news." 1 50
And all said: "Yes."
Then they made arrows and bows. After four days I they went on
the warpath. They stopped over night. I The people of Kqawakmituk started also. They did not go far, and staid over night. II In 55

friend had forgotten. | Then the friend of Pipe Lighter became hungryo
At once I he remembered what he had been told. They were going
along, and I the friend of Pipe Lighter thought: "Well, let me try!"
There was a tree, | and there was a burl on it. Pipe Lighter was
addressed: [l "Pipe Lighter!"  Hesaid: "What is it?"  Hewastold: 65
"A bear." I He said: "Where is it?"  He was told: "Farther on, on
a tree." I They said to one another: "Hold on!"  They whispered, I
because the bear was wild. Therefore they whispered, I so as not to
scare it away. They looked at what they referred. to. [1 It was a 70
burl. Then Pipe Lighter took out his arrow. I He went there softly.
Then they said to one another: "Behold, he will make a mistake!" I
Then they looked at it, and they laughed at him. I They did not make
any noise when they laughed at him. Pipe Lighter went there I and
looked around to see it. Then he aimed at it. 1I The people were 75
laughing. He shot. There was a noise of an arrow striking wood, I
but already he had another arrow ready to shoot. Then they laughed
aloud, I because he was shooting at wood. | He shot again, and hit
something soft. His arrow stuck out, I and there was the noise of a
bear. It was seen that the wood was moving. 11 The bear started to  80
run up the tree. It stopped; [ and while they were looking at it for a
little while, it fell down. [ It was killed. Then Pipe Lighter and his
friend scared the people. I They began to eat the bear. I
After they had eaten it, they went on. They went along. 11 Nothing  85
was seen yet, and they were again hungry. Now, I there were two
other friends. The one knew I what his friend had told him. There
was a brook, and they went to the water. I His friend said to him:
"What did you say?" (I do not know I the names of the friends.)
The friend said: "Friend!" 11 He said: "What?"  He was told: 90
"Thereis a charr." I He said: "Wait, wait! Therearemany." They
said to each other: I "Wait! There are charrs."  Then the friends
were looked at. I The one put on what he was going to use as a spear. I
He did not look. He was not looking there at 1[ the water. Then he 95
went along softly. Then it was seen I that he was about to spear
wood. Now theylaughed I and whispered. Then he threw his spear,
and it struck something soft. I It moved and became a charr. I It
was taken out of the water. It was eaten. It was small. They
were not satiated, 11 because there were many. 1           100
They started again. They wanted to see what was happening.
They arrived, ] and did not see anything. Then in the evening they
went on. I At night those who were the last talked, and said: | "Wait!
It smells like people." 11 It was very dark. Then they smelled the 105

of people. I Wolf Hat said: "Let us start, here I where I am going.
You go along." It was very dark. Then I Wolf Hat started. He
went along. Wolf Hat smelled 11 the people. They went along. 110
Then I in the morning the wide trail of the warriors was seen. I There
also were warriors. They were going to fight against the Kutenai. I
They followed the trail, going along.
The friends went ahead to see what was going on. One was namedll
Lamb Hat, the other was named Raven Hat. I They went to a val- 115
ley and went on. After they reached the other side,. I one of them
said: "Go, friend! I can not do much with you, I friend." He saw
that down below there was a town. I They were about to put up a
tent. One man pointed right toward them. II Then Lamb Hat and 120
RavenHatstopped. | They stood there. When the one personpointed
their way, I many looked at them. I Lamb Hat was standing there.

said to him also: "You might be in some difficulty." II Then the one 125
standing ahead was looked at. I He jumped around, and a lamb
started up the mountain. | Lamb Hat had become a lamb. I Then the
one standing behind stood there. Then a bird flew that way. I A
small magpie flew that way to the head of the one standing there. f[
It stopped there and flew away again. I Then Raven Hat had turned 130
into a stump. I The people all laughed, because that man had jnade
a mistake I when he said that people had appeared on the one side. I
They said to him: "We shot the parents of the lamb. || Therefore it 135
is there. The other one is a stump. I You see, a bird flew to it." I
Then they laughed. The one who had seen it thought: l "They were
persons. When the lamb goes behind there, I it will become a man;
and when the bird flies away, |j it will also become a man again." I  140
Then the friends Lamb Hat and Raven Hat I saw each other.
They said: "Indeed, I did something."  The other one I said: "Indeed, I also did something." They talked together. | "Indded, let
us watch for a while!" Then they looked secretly 11 at their enemies. 145
After a while they saw I that they were beginning again to make
their tents ready. They said to each other: "Let us I start back!"

started. Now it was night. I They went along, and they arrived at
the town of their enemies. I It was a bad place. There were rough
bowlders around there. They could not I go down. The same one,
Lamb Hat, said: 11 "Come here, the way I am going!"  They went 155
that way, and started. I Lamb Hat said: "When I am going to step, I
come this way also." Then they started, going down. They did not'
make any noise on the stones. I Even though there were small stones,
they did not make any noise stepping on them. Then I they, all
went down to the place where there was good grass, and II they stir- 160
rounded the place where the enemy was encamped. Then I they
watched for them. They stood there. Early in the morning I they
threw up something. They saw it clearly, and they said: "Now
fight them!"  Then I they blew whistles and fought the 1I enemy. 1 165
Crazy Old Woman's son was the youngest one. He had not seen |
any fighting. He thought: "I'll go with Chief I Not-sitting-downLong. Whatever he does, I'll do." I Then Not-sitting-down-Long
began to pursue them, and the I] youth named Rattling Claws did not 170
turn his eyes from I the chief, Not-sitting-down-Long. Then he heard I
that the town was being destroyed. They said: I "Ha, he! There is
nobody like me [no man]. I hold Chief Harelip with my knife. I His
clothing is fringed on one side." The two friends, II Not-sitting-down- 175
Long and Rattling Claws, went along. The friends were already I
way in the town. They did not look at the tents. I They went'to
the middle. There was a tent there in the middle. ] Not-sittingdown-Long jumped quickly to the head of the tent and stabbed him
there. I He said: "Ha, he! There is nobody like me. I am the first
to hold down with my knife [1 Chief Harelip."  Then Rattling Claws 1 180
also spoke, and said: "Ha, he! There is nobody like me. I am the
first I to count coup for Chief Not-sitting-down-Long." Then I Notsitting-down-Long did not pull out his spear, and I Rattling Claws
also did not pull out his spear II from the place where he had stabbed 185
him. Then the noise stopped. 1,
Very early in the morning all the enemies had been killed. I The
two friends stood there. The people went there. | They looked, and
it was seen that I the friends Not-sitting-down-Long and Rattling
Claws had killed the chief. Then it was seen 11 that it was Chief 190
Harelip. Then they started back. I
The one who had seen the people the day before I always thought:
"I have seen people. I It is sure that they have turned into a lamb
and a bird. ] I shall not sleep to-night." Then he did so. 11 At night 195
when they slept, he hid himself. He went away I higher up. There

At night they came home. They told: " Rattling Claws I has been

Wolverene Hat was asked: "What would you do?"  He said: [1 "I
should work my manitou power, and I should go back I the same 15
way we came through." I
It was not long before one of them looked, and he saw | that already
they were pursued by enemies. The way they came | was a narrow
ledge (good place). Then the enemies came. They said to each
other: 11 "We are attacked."  Both stood up quickly. I One climbed 20
up the precipice. I The other one, when the attacking party came,
went back. I When the enemies saw them stand up I at the place
where the two stood, a lamb was seen going up, [1 and a wolverene 25
also came from there. I The wolverene had in its mouth the brisket.
They were not looked at. The I wolverene went past the place where
the crowd was. I They thought it was a wolverene, and they also
thought I it was a lamb, and then they were not looked at. When I1
they arrived at the place where the fire was, they looked about for 30
them. I They looked all over. There was nothing. They said to
one another: "Maybe I that wolverene that went past us was he, and
maybe I the lamb that went by was he." Then the lamb went out of
sight. It I went around and went down. Then it became a man
again. The other one 11 went along the bottom, below the precipice, 35
and also became I a person again. Then there was no lamb, and the
other one I was no longer a wolverene. Then they met again. I
They spoke the truth when they said they would work their manitou
power. Then they started.
Now, the enemies of the friends were Kuyo'kwe. [I Then the 40
Kuyo'kwe looked for the tracks of the friends; and they saw I that
the lamb had become a person, and that the I wolverene-what they
thought was a wolverene-was the other one. | They looked carefully
for the tracks. They knew that when I the lamb and the wolverene
had gone out'of sight, both had become |1 men again. They looked for 45
their tracks and followed them. I Then they met again. The two
went back. They were pursued [ along their trail. I
The friends went back. They saw a lake. They went out to the
water. I They saw a man on the shore of the lake. They went there.
They knew |l it was Pine Cone. Pine Cone was an old man. He was 50
hunting I muskrats. When they arrived, they said to him: "Run
away! They come I in pursuit of us." Pine Cone said: "You tell a
lie, Lamb I Hat." He'was told: "We tell the truth. The Kuyo'kwe
come I in pursuit of us." Pine Cone.said again: "You tell a lie. 11
Where should they come from to pursue us?" Then I the friends 55
looked back, and where they had come from they saw them. I The

are the Kuyo'kwe. | They are many."  Then Pine Cone was left, and
they went on. I-le looked and saw them. The enemies looked 60
terrible. I Then he started to run. The Kuyo'kwe arrived. I
The Kuyo'kwe saw that he was an old man, | and they said to one
another: "Don't kill him, for he is old!" I
The Kuyo'kwe went along. Pine Cone took off his blanket 11 and 65
tied it with rushes.1 He tied his blanket over them. He thought I
the Kuyo'kwe would think it was he. They saw that it was only I his
blanket, They did not look at it. The grass was standing there
with the blanket on. I When he was overtaken, he took his pointed
- arrow I and shot the Kuyo'kwe. The point did not pierce them. The
Kuyo'kwe || thought that the old man would kill them. Theylooked  70
at the arrow I which he shot. Then they laughed at him, because Pine
Cone's arrow had not pierced them. I He shot all his arrows, and the
points did not pierce I the Kuyo'kwe. They made fun I of Pine Cone,
and they thought they would not kill him. II After playing with him, 75
they would go on I in the direction where Lamb Hat and his friend
had gone. I After arriving at their camp, they were going to fight with
them. Now, Pine Cone had one arrow I left. There was no point to
it. He shot at a Kuyo'kwe, pierced him, I and killed him. When the
Kuyo'kwe saw that Pine Cone 1I had killed one of them, they spoke 80
among themselves. "Kill him, for Pine Cone has killed one of us!" I
He had no more arrows. He started to run. He thought the
Kuyo'kwe could not kill him. Then he I had no more arrows. He'
thought: "I must die, for I I have no more arrows." They pursued
him. He thought he would be shot. II Then he moved about his bow  85
on his back. He did this for the purpose ] that when the Kuyo'kwe
should shoot him, he would throw off the arrows. I When they reached
him, they struck him and knocked him down. Then the Kuyo'kwe
cried I because Pine Cone had killed one of them. Then they started
back I to their own country. [1
When Lamb Hat and his friend came back to the town, ] they said: 90
"A great number of Kuyo'kwe are pursuing us. I Maybe they have
killed Pine Cone." They were waiting for | the Kuyo'kwe to come.
They talked among themselves: "Now let us go! } Maybe the Kuyo'kwe do not come because they are fighting with Pine Cone." 1] Then 95
they went the way the two friends had come. I They arrived at the
lake. They went out to it, and they saw Pine Cone lying there and
one Kuyo'kwe lying there. | Then it was known that Pine Cone had
killed him. I The Kuyo'kwe had gone back when Pine Cone had
killed one of them. II That lake where Pine Cone was lying is now l 100
called Pine Cone.2 I
Now I have told about Pine Cone.

73. THE KUYO'KWE
Now, I'll tell how all old woman killed all the I Kuyo'kwe. I
They were camping about. One day they camped at I Smoky
Place, as it is called. On the following day they moved on. 11 Only  5
one old. woman remained on the village site. She was pounding
(bones). I Therefore she did not go. On the following day she was
goihg to leave I in the direction where the others had gone. Then at
night she boiled I the bones. She was going to take the fat along.
She thought: " I'll  boil all of them to-night. Early to-morrow morning I II shall start." I                                   10
Then the Kuyo'kwe followed the tracks of the people. It was
winter I and good traveling. The Kuyo'kwe arrived at Smoky Place.
When they arrived I at the village site, they saw a fire burning. They
came there, and | the warriors looked into the tent. They saw 11 one 15
old woman. They said to one another: "Let us go in. I We are
cold. Let us stay here over night in her tent. I It is cold." They
entered. They sat down. The old woman saw I the Kuyo'kwe enter.
She saw that there were many I warriors. She was afraid. They.
took off their clothes, I1 their moccasins, their leggings, and their shirts, 20
and dried them. The old woman arose. I She went out and brought
in fuel. She put it on the fire. I Then there was a great fire. The
Kuyo'kwe said: I "The old woman is good. She knows that we are
cold, and she makes a fire for us." I The old woman went there.
She untied a parfleche and took out lard. 11 She took two sticks and 25
put | the fat on the fire. Then the fire blazed up. Then it melted. I
The Kuyo'kwe laughed, and said: "That is a good I old woman.
She knows we are cold. She makes a fire for us. She sees I that we
are hungry, andshe prepares food for us."  Then 11 the old woman saw 30
that the fat was really melted. I She just stirred it. All the Kuyo'kwe were without clothing. I They were drying it. The old
woman moved it about, and then all the grease caught fire. I The
Kuyo'kwe jumped back. When I the old woman saw what they were
doing, she ran out quickly. |I She started to run. She took the fat 35
of the bones that she was boiling. I She did not know how to hold'
the light. She was holding a torch. I She put it on her head to
serve as a light. I When she ran out, she ran. She noticed I that the
Kuyo'kwe said: "Pursue her! Strike her on the headr" 1 The old.40
woman went out. She knew which way she was going. | The Kuyo'kwe went along. It was very dark. They saw which way she
went. I They began to know it, because she had a light. They knew
that she had just I put a fire on her head. She did not take it off.

Therefore I the Kuyo'kwe knew where she went. She had taken the
fire. 11 There was a cliff, and she threw the torch down and jumped 45
aside. I She lay down. Then the Kuyo'kwe I followed the old woman.
Now the fastest runner had almost overtaken her. [ He did not see
that she had taken off the torch quickly, I and that she had just
thrown it over the cliff. They thought it was still |I the old woman. 50
When the fire was falling, he just I jumped down. He did not know
that there was a cliff. Then the I many Kuyo'kwe jumped down. |
All went down over the high bank. Then they were all I killed. The
old woman got up again. She heard the Kuyo'kwe i1 below groaning. 55
She went back to her tent. I There was nobody there. She had
killed them all. I
She thought: "My son is not a chief. I'll go to him. I He shall
come." Then she started. She traveled the way they had gone. [
Then she arrived, and entered the tent of her son. [1 She said to him: 60
"Go on; go to my tent. I killed all the Kuyo'kwe. [ Some of them
are not dead. Kill them. Much is their property. I Take some
good clothing. You are not a chief. | Then you will be a chief."
Then the youth started. I After a while the old woman told about
what had happened. 1| Then all started. When they got there; the 65
youth had already killed I all those who were not dead. He had killed
them and I taken their property. Then the youth became ] a chief. I
Now, I have told how the old woman killed all the I| Kuyo'kwe. 1 70
74. THE GREAT EPIDEMIC
Well, I'll tell a story of what happened long ago. {
The people were living there, and at once they had an epidemic.
They died. I All died. Then they went about. They told one
another the news. I Among all the Kutenai there was sickness.
They arrived at one town, II and told the news to one another. It was 5
everywhere the same. I At one town they did not see anybody.
They were all dead. I Only one person was left. One day the one
that was left was cured. I He was a man. He was alone. He
thought: "Well, I let me go around this world to see if there is any
placewhere there is any one. If there is no one left, 11 I won't see it 10
again. There is nobody. Nobody ever comes on a visit." Then I
he started in his canoe. He went about in it. He started in his
canoe, and I came to the last camp of the Kutenai. When he arrived
by the water where the people used to be, ] there was nobody; and
when he went about, he saw only dead ones, ] no signs (of a living
person). He knew that nobody.was left. 1I There,were no signs (of 15
life). After the one who was alive had left, not having seen anything, I he went along in his canoe. He arrived where there had been

a town. lie went out, I and there were only dead ones. There was
nobody in the town. I He started to go back. Then he came to the
last place where Kutenai lived. He went | to the town, and dead
bodies were all piled up 11 inside the tents. He always went about, and 20
he knew | that all the people were gone. He was crying as he went
along. j He thought: "I am the only one left in this country, for the
dogs I also are dead." When he came to the farthest village, I he went
about, and he saw some footprints of people.'ll They had a tent. 25
There were no dead bodies. Farther away there I was the village
site. He knew there must be two or three (alive). I He even saw
footprints-large ones and smaller ones. I He did not know if there
were three. He knew some one was saved. He went on in his canoe, |
and thought: "I'll paddle that way. Those who lived here used to
go that way. [I If it is a man, he might have moved." I Then he 30
started in his canoe. He went along in his canoe, and saw above
there I two black bears eating berries. He thought: "I'll go | and
shoot them. If I shoot them, I'll eat them. I'll dry them. Then
I'll I see if any one is left. After I have dried the meat, 11 I'll look for 35
them. I have seen footprints of people. They might be hungry
men I or women. They shall eat." Then he started, and went there I
where the bears were. He arrived, and saw I that they were not
bears, but women. He saw one older one, I and the other one a girl.
He thought: 11 "I am glad to see people. Let me take that woman 1 40
to be my wife." Then he went and took hold of I the girl. The girl
spoke, and said to her mother: "Mother, I I see a man."  Her mother
looked. The woman saw I that her daughter was telling the truth.
She saw a man II taking her daughter. Then the woman and I the girl 45
and the youth cried, because they saw that all ] the Kutenai were
dead. When they saw each other, | they all cried together. The
older woman said: "Don't I take my daughter. She is still small.
Take me. || You shall be my husband. Later on, when this my 50
daughter is large, I she shall be your wife. Then you shall have
children." I Then the youth married the older woman. I It was not
long before the woman said: " Now I I see that my daughter is grown
up. Now she may be II your wife. It is good if you have children. 1 55
Her body is strong now." Then the youth took I the girl for his wife.
Then the I Kutenai increased from these.
Now I have told what happened long ago. Enough.

75. THE GIANT
There was a town. All the youths were eaten by a giant. I Then 60
an old woman and her husband cried, for their children were dead. |
Every day the giant went to that town at night. I There, at the far
end, was a tent. He went there, I and he saw an old man and an old
woman. He thought: 1I "I'll sleep, and in the morning I'll eat the old 65
man and I the old woman." Then he slept. Early in the morning
the old couple cried. | While crying, the old woman arose. She was
about to start a fire, | when she saw some one sleeping. She looked
at him. It was | the giant. She told her husband: "Look at the
giant sleeping 11 inour tent!" The husband arose, took I his knife, 70
and cut off the giant's head. He shouted. I The people said: "Why
are the old couple glad? I They were crying." They went there, and
the giant was lying there. They had killed him. I
Now I have told what the old couple did [[ long ago. 1   75
76. THE GIANT1
Well, I'll tell you what happened to a newly married man I among
the people of olden times who became a giant. I
There was a town. There was a newly married youth. He went
hunting. i The newly married youth was a skillful II hunter. (I do not 5
know his name.) He killed I a mountain sheep. He skinned it. After
skinning it, he felt hungry. I He thought: "I will dry some of it, so
that it may be light. | I will carry it to-morrow. It is far, and it
would be heavy if I should not dry it." I Then he made a place to
dry it. He began to cut up J1 the meat, and hung it up. He was 10
about to hang almost all I on his drying frame. There were two thin
pieces of meat | lying there. He did not know where they fell off
from. I He was hungry. He thought: "I'll eat it."  He put the
meat on the fire; I and when it was done, he ate. It tasted good. 11
What he had killed did not taste that way. He thought: "What 15
may it be, that it tastes so good?" I He looked at it for some time,
but he did not see where it had come from. I Then he sat down.
When it was dark, he felt a pain here. I He looked, and he saw that
his own flesh was missing. I He looked at it, and he saw that a knife
had done it. Then 11 he knew that it was his own flesh that tasted 20
good. I He thought: "Well, I'll cut off another piece of my flesh." I
He cut it off, put it on the fire, and when it was done he ate it
Then he saw ] that it tasted good. He wanted some more. He began
to cook I his flesh on the fire, and, although he had eaten, he wanted.
some more. 11 Then there was no more flesh on his legs. It was late 25

followed his tracks. I He went along, and saw where his younger
brother had killed I the mountain sheep. He could see his tracks 40

his leg is broken, I and therefore he does not go home." He went

III. ABSTRACTS AND COMPARATIVE NOTES


The folk tales of the Kutenai show intimate relations to the tales
of the tribes of the plateaus, as well as to those of the plains east of
the mountains. A considerable number of tales are common to the
Kutenai and the neighboring Salish tribes, particularly the Okanagon.
There are also a considerable number of identical tales found among
the Kutenai and the Blackfeet.
It seems that the series of Transformer tales centering around
Nalmu'qtse and Ya.ukue'ika'm are peculiar to the Kutenai, although
the tale of the origin of arrows is also known to the Okanagon. These
tales are quite distinct from the Transformer tales of the Shuswap
and Thompson Indians, and also from the tales of Old One as found
among the Blackfoot. In 1891 I was told that when human beings
were first created, they arose before they were quite finished, and
danced until they fell down dead. Then human beings were created
who became the ancestors of the Indians.
So far as the incomplete material allows us to judge, one of the
most characteristic traits of Kutenai folk tales is the systematic
development of animal society. Frog is the old grandmother of
Muskrat, the Chipmunks, and Doe. Her brother, Owl, is hostile to
her grandchildren. The fish K!e'k!o'm is the grandfather of Doe,
but his relationship to Frog is not stated. The Chipmunks are the
wives of Fisher. Chicken Hawk's wife is Grouse. Coyote's wife is
Dog. Their children are Misqolo'wum and Q!ota'ptsek!. Coyotes'
brothers are Moose and Kingfisher. The only animal that is married
to various people is Doe, but it is not certain whether the same Doe
is meant every time. She is the wife of White Stone. Their child is
Ya.ukue'ika'm. Ya.ukue'ika'm's brother, is the father of Duck.
The Doe is also married to Wolf, and at another place to Lynx. Lynx
and Doe have two sons, who are Sun and Moon. The other animals
do not seem to be related to this group, but live in the same village,
and are either friends or enemies.
It is one of the characteristic traits of Kutenai and Okanagon
mythology that the tales are welded together into connected groups.
This tendency is not as marked as it is among the Navaho and probably also the Ute tribes, but it sets off the Kutenai tales clearly from
the disconnected tales of the Shuswap and Thompson Indians.
In our series one group of tales centers around the creation of the
sun. The first part of the story relates to the origin of the brothers
who finally become sun and moon. Rabbit finds his sister Doe,
whom he hides in the tent of his grandmother Frog. Lynx marries
the Doe, and their children are two boys. The couple are deserted;

and when the boys grow up, they come to the place where the sun is
being made (see p. 285).
The second part of the story begins with the origin of Ya.ukue'ikam,
who also goes to the place where the sun is being made and tries his
powers. The story of his origin is briefly as follows: Frog's granddaughter, Doe, is taken into the water by White Stone, whom she
marries. Their son is Ya.ukue'ikam, who in a number of exploits
obtains for the use of mankind arrow wood, the arrow straightener,
sinew, flint, and the bow stave (see p. 290). Then he goes with Coyote
to the place where the sun is being made. They pass a number of
dangers-the fat, the giant, and the thunderbirds (see p. 285).
When the various parties meet, one after another tries to act as the
Sun, and finally the sons of the Lynx are accepted.
We have no other incidents that are clearly connected with this
tale, but I suspect strongly that the tale of the deluge produced by
the Chicken Hawk may connect in a similar way with the story of
the Sun (see p. 304).
On account of Ya.ukue',ka'm's great powers, the people are afraid
of him and drown him. The fish resuscitate him; and he follows the
people, finds his brother's wife and her son, and tells them to resist
those who maltreat them. He kills the chief, and the people are
even more afraid of him (see p. 291). This passage recalls the story
of Coyote's son (see MAFLS 11:120). Finally Ya.ukue'ika-m goes to
the east end of the world (see p. 291).
The second cycle, apparently independent of the former one, is that
of the war against the sky.
Nalmu'qtse crawls about in the country, and his tracks form the
rivers (see p. 288). During this period Muskrat kills his sister-in-law
and escapes to the sky. The animals make a chain of arrows and
climb up, but Wolverene tears the chain. The animals fight with
Muskrat. When they find the arrow chain -broken, they kill the
thunderbird, and with its feathers they fly down. The Bat and the
Flying Squirrel, who receive no feathers, sail down. The Sucker
jumps down and breaks its bones. The Woodpecker family are not
given feathers. They climb down the sky, and reach the earth in
the west, passing through the horizon (see p. 288). They meet
Nalmu'qtse and try to kill him by throwing into his mouth a redhot stone wrapped in a goat heart. Nalmu'qtse causes it to fall
aside. He warns the woodpeckers not to sleep in wooded places and
not to touch a charr floating in the water (see pp. 288,289). The
Woodpeckers disobey; and when they sleep in a wooded place, a toad
sticks to the body of one of them. When Flicker touches a charr, he
and his wife Duck are swallowed by a water monster. In order to
find out where Flicker is, Woodpecker sends out birds to invite the
fish to his tent. They come led by their grandfather (a fish with

thick head). They smoke, and the fish indicates by signs that
Flicker is in the lake. The Woodpeckers try in vain to kill the water
monster, which escapes along the Columbia River. At Red Water,
near Windermere, it is wounded: therefore the water is red there.
It escapes into a cave. Nalmu'qtse is told to stop up the outlet of
the river, and he makes the portage separating Columbia Lakes from
Kootenai River by molding the soil with his knees. Fox kills the
monster. They cut it up, and Flicker and his wife Duck come out.
The flesh of the monster is thrown about to serve as food for the
people (see p. 289).
Then Nalmu'qtse arises, his head touches the sky, his hat falls
down, and he himself falls over and dies.
In the Okanagon tales the making of the bow and arrow, which
forms a large part of the Ya.ukue'ika'm tradition, is connected with
the war on the sky. The most connected form of the tale has been
recorded by Albert S. Gatschet (Globus, vol. 52, p. 137). The animals make war against the sky in order to obtain the fire. They are
unable to reach the sky with their arrows. The Wren decides to make
a bow and arrow. First he kills an elk (here is introduced the story
of Chickadee and Elk, p. 304). The Wolf tries to steal the elk, and
Wren throws red-hot stdnes wrapped in fat into his mouth. He uses
the rib of the elk for making his bow. He obtains the feathers for
his arrow by allowing the eagle to carry him into his nest. He
obtains flint by causing the owners of flint to fight. Then he goes
to the place where the animals shoot the arrows up to the sky. He
meets Coyote. (Here is introduced a story of the small animal that
is able to shoot trees. See Blackfoot, de Josselin de Jong VKAWA
14:73; Uhlenbeck VKAWA 13:182; Pend d'Oreilles, Teit MAFLS
11:114.)
The Wren kills Coyote, and Fox resuscitates him. Coyote meets
the Wren a second time. They gamble, and he wins Wren's clothing.
He goes on, and meets young Grouse, whom he kills. The old Grouse
then scares him so that he falls down a precipice (see p. 293). Wren
recovers his arrows, makes the arrow chain, and the animals climb
up. / When Grizzly Bear climbs up, the chain breaks, owing to his
weight. Then Eagle, Beaver, and Turtle are sent to obtain the fire.
(See Lillooet, JAFL 25:299, where other references are given.)
The Turtle falls down-from the sky and kills a person. Then follows
the story of the Turtle who asks to be thrown into the water (see
p. 305). The story closes with the return of the animals.
In the following I give brief abstracts of the tales recorded in the
present volume and of those published by me in the "Verhandlungen

1. THE SUN (4 versions: Nos. 33, 48, 54, and VAEU 23:161). First Version.-Coyote  49
asks Chicken Hawk to accompany him to the place where the Sun is being made.
Coyote wants to try first to act as the Sun'. Chicken Hawk tells him that on their
way they will pass grease, and that in passing he may take one bite. Coyote disobeys, takes more than one bite, and the grease falls down and rolls down a precipice
with Coyote. They reach the place where the Sun is being made. Coyote walks
along the sky, but is found unsatisfactory. Chicken Hawk follows, and is found to be a
good Sun.l Coyote is envious and tries to shoot him.2 His bow and arrows catch
fire, and the earth begins to burn. He lies down on a trail, which does not burn,
and he is saved.3
Second Version.-The animals try who is to be the Sun. When Raven acts as the  67
Sun, it is dark. When Chicken Hawk tries, the sky is yellow. When Coyote tries, it
is hot. He tells everything he sees. When he returns, they tell him that he is too
hot and too talkative. A woman has two children, who arrive, and try in their turn.
When the first one goes along the sky, it is comfortable; and when the sun sets, it is  69
cool. He is selected as Sun. The younger brother is selected to act as the Moon.' Coyote
is envious and shoots the Sun at sunrise.2 His arrow catches fire, the earth begins to
'burn, and he saves himself by lying down on a trail. For this reason trails do not burn.3
Third Version.-Coyote and Ya.uikue',ka'm are traveling along. Ya.ukue/ika'm  111
tells Coyote that they will pass a piece of fat, and that he may take one bite. After
they pass, Coyote turns back in order to have another bite, and the fat rolls down.
He runs after it. The fat falls into the water and sinks. When he goes back on his
tracks, all the fat has been transformed into white stone. In order to get the fat that

has fallen into the water, he heats stones, intending to boil it. Ya.ukue'lka'm misses
Coyote, and finds that the fat is gone. He follows down to the water, and sees Coyote
engaged in heating stones. Ya.ukue/,ka'm makes a spear and spears the fat, which
113  breaks up and floats.-They go on, and Ya.ukue',ka'm tells Coyote not to pay any
attention if he should hear a child crying. After they pass the child, Coyote turns
back and puts his finger into the child's mouth. The child sucks the finger and
pullsin Coyote's arm. WhenYa.uku/ika'm notices that the child is silent, he turns back
and kills the child with his knife. All the flesh on Coyote's arm has been sucked off.
The child was a giant.-They go on, and Ya.ukue/ika'm tells Coyote not to listen if
he should hear birds crying. Coyote disobeys, and finds himself in the nest of the
thunderbirds together with Ya.ukue/ka'm. Ya.ukue/,ka'm asks the young thunderbirds when the old birds come back. They reply that they come back in the evening
115 in the form of a thundercloud. Ya.ukue'/ka'm tells Coyote that the thunderbird will
ask whether he is tired, and that he is to reply that his younger brother Ya.ukue/'ka'm
is tired. When this happens, Ya.ukue/,ka'mis told by the old thunderbird to stretch
out hig leg, because the bird wants to suck out the marrow. At this moment
Ya.ukue/,ka'm kills the thunderbird with his spear. The same is repeated when the
old male thunderbird comes back. When the old birds are dead, Ya.ukuefka'm sits
on the back of one of the young thunderbirds, which flies up, and then carries him
117  down, while Coyote is shouting. Then Coyote sits on the back of the other thunderbird; and when he shouts, the bird takes him down. Ya.ukue'ika'm ordains that,  thunderbirds may only scare people who lie about them.l Ya.ukue/'ka'm and Coyote
reach the place where the Sun is being made. Ya.ukuet'ka'm is tried; but the day
is red because his clothing is painted with ochre. Coyote is tried, but when he acts
as the Sun, it is too hot; and he tells what the people are doing, and asks them to leave
119  some food for him. The two sons of the Lynx arrive. They have been brought up
by their mother, who had been deserted by Lynx. He had gone to catch salmon for
making soup for his wife. The young Lynxes meet him, and he tells them that he is
unable to catch salmon. The boys show him how to catch salmon. When the Lynx
children arrive at the place where the animals try to make the Sun, one of them goes
121 up and is found a satisfactory sun.2  Then they send the other one up as the Moon. Coyote
is envious and shoots at the rising sun,3 which sets his arrow on fire. The fire pursues
him. He lies down on a trail and covers himself with a blanket. The fire passes
over him without hurting him. Therefore trails do not burn.4

Fourth Version1 (VAEU 23).-Hare's wife (a small red bird) has deserted him and (162)
lives with a red hawk. Hare finds tracks of elks (not moose, as given in the original),
and goes home to make snowshoes. The animals start in pursuit of the elks. When
Hare goes to get wood for his snowshoes, he meets Doe. He wishes to marry her.
She refuses him. He goes home and tells his grandmother Frog what has happened.
She informs him that the Doe is his sister. Hare takes her home, and she lives in the
tent. Her presence is unknown to the other people. Hare goes out to pursue the
elks. His grandmother tells him to put mittens on his feet in place of his snowshoes.
When going out, he meets Raven and other hunters, who are returning empty handed.
They maltreat him, but he goes on. He meets Woodpecker, a diver, and Wolf. He
passes the game hunters, and meets Hawk and his wife, who pelt him with snow.
Only Weasel, Fox, and young Wolf are ahead of him. On the following day he'meets
them. They return, because they are unable to overtake the elks.
Hare puts on his mittens and soon overtakes the elks. With one arrow he kills (163)
one-half of them, and with the second the rest. He butchers them and shakes the fat,
which becomes small in size. He fills the stomachs with blood, piles them up, and
tells them to burst if any one should carry them. He carries the fat home, shakes it,
and it assumes its former size. He feeds his child, and throws some fat into the fire
in order to inform his brother Duck, who comes and is given food. He sends his brother
to tell the people that they may go to bring in the meat. He wishes that Hawk should
select the stomachs. Bear demands the ribs; Wolf, the legs; Raven, the eyes. Hawk
loads the stomachs on the back of his wife. Hare follows them, steps on her snowshoes, so that she falls. The blood runs over her, and she freezes to death. The skins
are carried into Frog's tent. When within a few days they are ready tanned, the
people grow suspicious, and find the tracks of Doe. Lynx finds the place where the
girl stopped, tears out four hairs, which he puts on the ground. The hairs impregnate
her when she urinates. Doe gives birth to a child. The people hear it crying, and discover the Doe. In order to discover the unknown father of the child, Frog orders the
men to take up the child.2 Coyote, Raven, and others take it, but the child continues to cry. Lynx comes back from hunting. He buries his clothing and strike-alight under stones. When the people see Lynx coming, the child quiets down; and (164)
when he takes it up, it does not cry any more.. They maltreat Lynx, extinguish the
fires, and desert him, Doe, and their child.3
Lynx is a good hunter. After some time Doe has a second son. The people are
starving. Lynx's grandmother, Magpie, comes to look after her grandson: He feeds
her. In summer Lynx goes to fish salmon. He makes a fish weir. When the boys
are grown up, their mother sends them to the place where the sun is being made. She
tells them that they will pass their father's fishing-place. The boys start and reach
the place where the sun is being made. Raven is the sun; it is dark and cold. Coyote
acts as sun; it is very hot, and he tells the people to keep food for him. Because he
runs home quickly the day is short. He tells everything he has seen in the daytime.
The sons of Lynx are tried, and one is made the sun, the other the moon.4 Coyote is (165)
envious, and shoots the sun at sunrise. His arrows catch fire, fall down, and set fire
to the grass.5

73     2. THE WAR ON THE SKY 1 AND NALMU/QTSE (3 versions: Nos. 50, 52, and VAEU
23:165). First Version.-Muskrat wants to marry his brother's widow. She refuses
him, and he kills her with an arrow which differs in style from the tribal arrows.2
The people try to find out who killed her, and call in Frog, Muskrat's grandmother.
Although she knows what has happened, she declines to tell, and answers by signs.
The people think that the Sky people have killed the woman, and decide to make
75   war on the Sky. They shoot arrows up to the Sky and make a chain.3     Since it is
not quite long enough, Raven puts his beak at the lower end. Then it reaches the
ground. When the animals are ready to go up, Wolverene asks them to wait for two
days because he has to put away his things. When he comes back, he finds the animals have gone. He becomes angry and tears down the chain of arrows. The remaining people pursue Wolverene, who, when almost overtaken, cuts up himself and
becomes a squirrel, which he puts under his own belt. When somebody thinks he
recognizes him, he says that he is hunting squirrels.-Muskrat has made a large lake
in the sky and put up many tents around it. When the people attack the village,
a left-handed man comes out. This happens in every tent, and the people recognize
that there is only one person, Muskrat. They go back; and when they come to the
place where the arrow chain had been, it is gone. They go to the drinking-place of
Thunderbird, kill him, and.distribute his feathers. While these are being distributed,
two bats expect to be given the best feathers, but finally nothing is left for them.
77   They spread out their blankets and sail down. Flying Squirrel pulls out his skin
and sails down. The Sucker throws himself down and is broken to pieces. When
his brother's widow touches him, he is cured.-The warriors Flicker, the Woodpeckers
and their sister (a bird with yellow breast and gray feathers), have been left in the
sky. They walk to the place where heaven and -earth meet. At Nelson they meet
supernatural beings, who tell them never to touch a fish and not to stay over night
in the woods. They find a charr which has drifted ashore. Flicker tries to kill it,
but is swallowed by it and taken into the lake.4 They camp in the woods, and a toad
crawls under Woodpecker's blanket and sticks to his body. The others go on and
meet Nalmu'qtse, who was crawling along Kootenai River naming the country. He
asks the Woodpeckers, his nephews, for some food. They put a red-hot stone into the
79   heart of a mountain goat, and try to throw it into his mouth.5 They miss, and the
place is called Little Heart. Woodpecker sends two water birds to invite in all the
Fish, telling them that the lake will be dried up if they should not come. The birds
dance at every bay, inviting the Fish. The chief of the Fish, K!'/k!om', is the last
to arrive. He is given a pipe; and Woodpecker, his brothers, and the Fish smoke.
The Fish inquires for his grandson; that is, the Flicker that had been swallowed
by the water monster; and he moves his eyebrows, showing that Flicker is in the
lake. As a reward he is given meat, which may now be seen as a red spot on each side
of the body. The Woodpeckers make ready to kill the water monster. The first who
tries to attack him is Long Legs, who, however, is swallowed. Woodpecker tries
next. He intends to kick the monster, but the blow glances off. The monster is
chased along Kootenai River and comes back by way of Windermere to Red Water.
81   Woodpecker hits it on the foot. Its blood makes the water red. At Long-Water Bay

the monster hides in a cave under water. Flicker takes Woodpecker's war bomnet
and spear and tries to chase the monster out of the water. When the monster appears,
Flicker is afraid, and drops the spear. Nalmu'qtse is asked to dam up the end of the
lake and to prevent the escape of the monster. He breaks off a piece of the mountain
and solidifies it with his knees, making the portage between Columbia River and Kootenai River. Woodpecker continues the pursuit; but when the monster looks at
him, he becomes afraid and is unable to kill it. The Fox finally takes a tomahawk,
kills the monster, and cuts it up. Flicker and Duck come out. They have become
white in the stomach of the monster. While in its stomach, they made a fire with
their canoe. The monster had asked them not to make too large a fire, because it
might melt its fat. The Flicker had been worn down to its present size.
They cut off the ribs of the monster and throw them down the river, where they
become a cliff. The body is cut up and scattered about. It becomes the food of the  83
people. They forget the Kutenai, and only a little blood is left, which they scatter
over the country. For this reason the Kutenai arefew.l
Second Version.-Nalmu'qtse is called the grandfather of the Kutenai. He is a man   85
of giant size, and never stands up. He knows that he is about to die, and travels over
the country, giving names to places. Wherever he crawls, a river flows.2 He meets   87
the Woodpecker brothers and their sister sitting on a mountain. They have come
down from the sky after the animals have made war on Muskrat (as told before). They
are angry because they have not been given any feathers to fly down. Woodpecker
tries to kill the people; and when he meets his uncle Nalmu'qtse, he tries to kill him
too. He throws a heart containing a red-hot stone at him, pretending that it is food.3
Nalmu'qtse nods, and it falls down, and the place is called Little Heart. Nalmu'qtse
warns Woodpecker, telling him not to touch a charr and not to sleep in dense woods.
The Woodpeckers disobey, and Flicker is swallowed by a water monster.4 Nalmu'qtse
crawls along and decides to stand up. When he rises, his war bonnet touches the sky.
It falls, and he also falls, saying that the place will be called Ear.               89
Third Version (VAEU 23).-The father of Muskrat 5 has two wives. After his death (165)
Muskrat wants to marry his second wife, who refuses him. He shoots her with an
arrow of unknown design. He lies down, pretending to be sick. The people find the
dead woman, and inquire for the owner of the arrow. Muskrat smells of it, and says
it came from the sky. They make war against the sky. Coyote shoots up an arrow
without reaching it. Other animals try in vain. Finally two Hawks shoot. Their
first arrow strikes the sky after flying one day and one night. They make a chain of
arrows,6 which Raven completes by putting his beak in the nock of the last arrow.
Wolverene asks the other animals to wait, because he wants to look after his traps.
They leave before he returns; therefore he is angry and tears down the arrows, which
are transformed into a mountain (Mount Baker, near Cranbrook, B. C.). Muskrat
has climbed up into the sky, where he makes tents along the shore of a lake. The
houses are dirty. He shoots from the houses, passing under ground from one to the

(166) When they find the arrow chain broken, they snare thunderbird, put on his feathers,
and fly down. Those who receive feathers are transformed into birds; the others, intofish
and land mammals. Coyote sails down, steering with his tail. The Sucker breaks all
his bones. He is given new ones: therefore the sucker's body is now full of bones.
89    3. YA.UKUEitA-M (No. 53).-Frog warns her granddaughter, Young Doe, not to
drink at a water hole. She disobeys,l and is pulled down by a man named White
Stone, who lives in the water, and marries her. Their son is Ya.ukue/ika m. —LWhite
Stone's brother, Gray Stone, dislikes Ya.ukue/,ka'm, who is sent by his mother to visit
91 hisgreat-grandmother Frog. Ya.ukue/,ka'm goes; and whenhe sees the old FrogWoman,
he is afraid.2 He makes her sleep and plays in the tent. He goes back to his mother,
who wants him to stay with his great-grandmother. When Frog wakes, she notices
that somebody has been there. She makes a small bow and a small basket, and hangs
them up. Ya.ukue/,ka'm gets back, makes her sleep again, and plays with the bow,
which he breaks. When the Frog wakes, she says that her grandchild must have been
a boy, because he had been playing with a bow. Next time the Frog captures him.
93 When Ya.ukue/ka'm is growing up, he asks the Frog Woman for arrow wood and
service-berry wood.3  She warns him, but he sets out to obtain the wood from the
Grizzly Bear, who owns it. Cranes, Marmots, and Beavers are Grizzly Bear's watchmen, appointed to warn him of the arrival of strangers. The youth bribes them to
be quiet until he returns. He takes the service-berry bushes and makes his escape.
95  The animals make a noise; Grizzly Bear assumes his animal form, and pursues
Ya.ukue/ika'm. The animals make excuses, but the Bear threatens to kill them after
having overtaken Ya.ukue/,ka'm, who causes a hill to rise behind him, which detains
Grizzly Bear. Thus arrow wood is obtained. He goes to his mother's tent, and Gray
Stone promises to kill Grizzly Bear. Gray Stone rubs himself with grease and becomes
a stone, which is heated by the fire. He orders Ya.ukue/ika'm to stand next to the
doorway. Grizzly Bear, when trying to bite him, closes his eyes; Ya.ukue/,ka'm steps
aside, and the Bear bites the post. Meanwhile Gray Stone becomes so hot, that the
97 stone almost bursts. Just when the Bear opens his mouth, the fragments of the stone
fly about; Gray Stone goes right through Grizzly Bear, who dies. After this the Grizzly
Bear remains a bear. Ya.ukue/ika'm skins the grizzly bear, and drags the skin which is
attached to the head into Frog Woman's tent. She is afraid of the grizzly bear. She
paints her legs red and stands in the doorway, holding a hammer. She had put up a
sharp stone in the doorway. Ya.ukue'ika'm drags the grizzly-bear skin in, and Frog
strikes it; but Ya.ukue/,ka'm jerks it at that moment, so that she strikes the stone,
99  which she breaks. Ya.ukue/ika'm asks for feathers for his arrow. He is told that
ducks on a lake own the feathers. He goes there, wearing ear ornaments. Ya.ukue/ika'm, who is painted red, asks one of the Ducks to come ashore, asks for his feathers,
and promises to pay him with his ear ornaments. The Duck obeys, and becomes
101 very beautiful. When the other Ducks see it, they all go ashore, and he takes their
feathers. He adorns all of them.4  Thus feathers are obtained.
Ya.ukue/ika'm goes to obtain the arrow straightener from Bighorn Sheep. He goes
to Bighorn Sheep, who tells him that the arrow straightener is on the other side of the
river. When he is climbing the mountain, Bighorn goes back across the river in his

taken care of by his brothers and sisters, (probably animals) that live there. The
house owner counteracts Bighorn's charm by striking his testicles. Bighorn thinks
he hears the bursting of Ya.ukue/,ka'm's eyes, and Bighorn causes the cold to stop.
While it is cold, Bighorn is throwing warm things on himself. After some time Bighorn Sheep returns to look for Ya.ukue/ika'm. After the Bighorn has crossed the
river, Ya.ukue/ika'm goes into his canoe, crosses the river, and does the same as the
Bighorn has done. A snowstorm arises, and he goes into Bighorn Sheep's tent and
throws warm things on himself. When he hears the noise of eyes bursting, he says,
"Don't let it be cold any more!"  After all this has happened, the old man has been
transformed into a mountain sheep, and Ya.ukue/ika'm takes the arrow straightener.
Thus man obtains the arrow straightener.
In order to obtain sinew, Ya.ukue/'ka'm goes to the tent of Mouse, who is afraid of 105
the Bull Moose, which almost breaks the tent. He obtains first a poor bow, then a
good bow, kills the Moose for Mouse, and takes the sinew. Thus man obtains sinew.'. He goes to obtain Flint.2  Flint is a man. If a person pays him well, he trans- i07
forms himself into stone. and allows pieces to be broken off. When Ya.ukue/'ka'm
arrives, Flint retains the form of a man, because he expects high pay. Ya.ukue',ka'm
tells Flint that Diorite Man claims to be stronger than Flint. By carrying tales from
one to the other he causes them to quarrel and to fight. When they strike each other,
large pieces of flint and diorite fall off, and he is able to obtain the stone he needs.
Thus he produces flint and tough stone for the use of man.
Ya.ukue/,ka'm goes to obtain bow wood. Two squirrels as large as grizzly bears 109
stand on each side of a trail. He kills them. From the body creeps the small squirrel
of our times. He passes between two moving trees, which crush any one who passes
between them. He keeps them apart by putting his spear across.3 Then he scatters
the cedar wood.
Ya.ukue/,ka'.m asks his mother where the sun rises, and he tells her that he is going
there.
4. THE   PEOPLE  TRY   TO  KILL YA.UKUE/iKA'M    (No. 55).-The   people kill 121
Ya.ukue'ika'm and throw him into the river. Then they break camp and order Crane
to drag a young tree to cover their tracks. The fish nibble at the drowned man's 123
body, and he awakes. He kicks the fish, but they say that they are restoring him.
He follows the people, meets Crane, whom he kills. He also kills Crane's wife. When
he approaches the people, he sees his sister-in-law, who is lagging behind and who is
crying. She carries her child, Duck, on her back. The child recognizes him and
tells his mother, who, however, disbelieves him. Ya.ukue/ika'm shows himself, and  125
she tells him that the people take away his brother's game, and that Duck has to render
menial services to the chief, that they also take away the.tent site that she is preparing.
Ya.ukue/ika'm tells his brother and his sister-in-law to resist the people.4  The people  127
are afraid when the two act independently. The chief, aft r defecating, calls Duck
to clean him, and Duck kills him with arrow points that he has attached to his head.5
Ya.ukue/ika'm shows himself, and the people are afraid of him.

191    5. COYOTE AND TREE CHIEF' (2 versions: No. 64 and VAEU          23:166).-Coyote
passes Tree Chief's tent. Tree Chief's mother likes him, and wishes him to become
193  her son's friend. The two friends go out. When they pass Wolf's trap, Coyote diverts
the attention of his friend and pushes him in. He pretends to be unable to pull him
out. He induces him to throw out all his clothing, including a hawk, which he carries on his head, and his saliva. Then he leaves him and goes to the town where a
chief lives who has two daughters. The chief, Golden Eagle, believes that he is
195  Tree Chief. Wolf and his wife find Tree Chief in the trap. He has taken the form
of a young child. Wolf wants to kill him; his wife wants to raise him. They agree
that whoever reaches him first shall do with him what he pleases. Wolf's wife digs
through the ground very quickly and rescues him.2
Tree Chief asks Wolf Woman for sinew, which the boy uses for making a netted ring.
197  He holds it up, and it is full of birds. Next he asks for the leg skin of a yearling
buffalo calf. He makes a netted ring, rolls it into the tent, and tells the woman to'
cover her head. It becomes a buffalo, which he kills. He tells the woman to put
the blood and guts behind the tent. On the following day they are transformed into
199  pemmican.    Coyote has married one of the daughters of Golden Eagle. Tree Chie
takes some pemmican, and goes to the river to draw water. - There he meets the
chief's daughter, to whom he gives the pemmican. Next the boy asks for the leg part
of the skin of a buffalo bull.  He obtains a buffalo in the same way as before. He
puts the blood in the skin and puts it away. On the next day the blood has been
transformed into pemmican; the skin, into a painted blanket. IHe goes again to draw
water, and tells the girl to say that she has received pemmican from the one whom
she saw at the river.
Tree Chief hides the buffalo, and the people in the village of Golden Eagle are
201 starving. Golden Eagle throws up a feather of his body, which becomes an eagle,
which is perched on a tree. He arranges a contest, and orders every one to try to
shoot the eagle. Each is to have one shot. Coyote shoots repeatedly, but does not
hit the eagle. Tree Chief appears, and hits the eagle. Coyote pretends that his
arrow had hit it; but when he is carrying along the bird on his arrow, it is seen that it
203  is a prairie chicken. The boy goes back to the Wolf. In the evening he meets the
girl again, and tells her that on the following day at noon he will show himself. He
goes to the village in the same form as he used to have. The people are puzzled,
because he himself and Coyote look alike. Tree Chief's saliva turns into shells, which
are eaten by the sparrow hawk that sits on the youth's head; while Coyote has lost
this art, and his hawk is starving.
205    Tree Chief tells the chief, his father-in-law, to look at his fortune-telling place. The
chief sees tracks of buffalo cows, and sends the people to go hunting. Tree Chief goes
ahead, piles up buffalo chips, which he transforms into buffaloes. The people kill
the buffaloes. Tree Chief takes an old mangy buffalo cow. He is laughed at by
207 Coyote. Tree Chief takes it home. He gives his arrow to his wife, and tells her not

to touch any one with it. When he is skinning the mangy cow, it turns into a fat
buffalo. A dog tries to get some of the meat. The woman touches it with the arrow,
and the dog falls down dead. When she touches it again, the dog revives. Coyote
also kills a dog, and tries to revive it by touching it with an arrow, but he is unsuccessful. Tree Chief's wife carries the meat in her blanket into her tent. On the    209
following morning the blood is transformed into pemmican; the skin, into a painted
blanket. Coyote is unable to imitate this feat. Coyote tries to make buffalo out of 211
buffalo chips, but is unable to do so. Finally Tree Chief gets impatient, and strikes
Coyote with a firebrand, intending to kill him.
Coyote runs westward, while Tree Chief goes eastward. Tree Chief says both will 213
come back at the end of the world.
Second Version (VAEU 23).-Tree Chief is Coyote's friend. Golden Eagle asks (166)
Tree Chief to marry his daughter. The two young men start, and on the way Coyote
throws Tree Chief into a pit. He asks for the bird which Tree Chief carries on his
head, for his blanket and saliva. He puts these on, leaves Tree Chief in the pit, and
goes to the village of Golden Eagle, where he marries the girl. Tree Chief transforms
himself into an infant. The owner of the pit and his wife try who can reach the child
first. Tree Chief by magic makes the soil loose where the woman is digging, so that
she reaches him first. When the boy is a few years old, he asks for a snare in order to
catch birds. He sets it, moves his hands, and the snare is full of birds. He asks for
the skin of a buffalo calf and makes a netted ring. He tells the old people to lie
down, and rolls the ring against the tent. The ring becomes a buffalo calf, which he
kills. The intestines, which the woman puts away according to the boy's orders, are
transformed into pemmican. The same happens to the skin of a one-year-old buffalo,
which is transformed into a young bull, which he kills. He tells the old people that
he is Tree Chief. He goes to the river and meets Golden Eagle's younger daughter,
whom he marries. The people are starving because the buffaloes have disappeared.
Tree Chief tells the hunters to wait at a buffalo drive. By kicking buffalo chips he
transforms them into buffaloes, which are driven to a precipice. There are two buffaloes for each hunter. Tree Chief selects an old lean one for himself. He tells his
wife not to strike their dog. When she disobeys, the dog falls down dead. He tells
her to strike the dog again, and the dog revives. Coyote is unable to imitate this.
Tree Chief drives away Coyote, reminding him that he had tried to kill him.
6. COYOTE AND Fox 1 (No. 1).-Coyote asks Fox for his blanket. They race. (This      1
is probably a reference to the tale of Coyote borrowing Fox's blanket and being carried
away by the wind.)                                                                    2
7. COYOTE AND LocusT (No. 2).-Coyote carries Locust. They meet a Grizzly Bear.      3
Coyote puts Locust down at the edge of a cliff. Locust scares the female Grizzly
Bear, who falls down the cliff and dies.2  Coyote and Locust eat the body. Later on
they meet the male Grizzly Bear. Coyote is put down and turns into a stump, which
the Grizzly Bear tries to bite. Coyote is retransformed and gives fat to the bear to
eat. He says it is beaver fat. The bear asks whether they have seen the female        4
Grizzly Bear. After first denying to have seen her, Coyote tells the Bear that he

falls, and his hands strike a buffalo horn, with which he scares away the Grizzly
Bear.'
141     8. COYOTE AND GRIZZLY BEAR 1 (No. 57).-Coyote sees Grizzly Bear feeding, and
143   calls him names.2  Grizzly Bear pursues him. While they are running, Coyote jumps
over the Bear. The Bear chases him around a stone. Coyote falls down and falls
on the horns of a buffalo, which stick on his hands. Coyote rises, and with the horns
frightens away the Bear. The Bear swims the river, and is hit with the horns.
3     9. COYOTE AND LOCUST 3 (No. 3).-Locust is carrying his leg. Coyote envies him,
4  and breaks his own leg too. The two make friends. Coyote goes ahead, and is kicked
by Locust, who kills him. When Magpie picks at Coyote's eyes,4 Coyote revives.
5  He slaps himself, and the dung tells him 5 that he will become a knife attached to
Coyote's foot. Locust goes ahead, and Coyote kills him.
5     10. COYOTE AND GRIZZLY BEAR (No. 4).-Coyote makes fun of Grizzly Bear's dung.'
6  In order to catch Coyote, the Bear first creates service berries, then wild cherries,
7  which Coyote does not eat. Then he creates rose hips; when Coyote is eating these,
Grizzly Bear catches him, together with the bushes. Coyote pleads that he did not
offend Grizzly Bear. When Grizzly Bear tries to hit him, Coyote runs away. He
8  calls for the help of his manitous. One of these becomes a river; another, a log which
lies across the river and bobs up and down; a third one becomes a tent. Coyote is
told to come out of the tent as soon as the Grizzly Bear appears, and to abuse him.
When the Bear reaches the river, he tries to cross on the bobbing log. Coyote holds
the log, but lets go of it while the Bear is crossing over it. The Grizzly Bear falls off
and is drowned.6
8     11. COYOTE GOES VISITING 7 (No. 5).-Coyote's wife is Dog. Coyote sends his chil9  dren to visit their uncles. They go to Kingfisher, who stretches his hand back to get
his sharp horn.   Kingfisher sends his two children to bring two switches. He ties his
hair over his forehead, and jumps from the top of the tent into the water through a
10 hole in the ice. He comes back carrying two switches filled with fish. The following
day Dog sends her children to visit their uncle Moose. Moose cuts off his wife's nose,
throws ashes on the cut, which heals up at once. He sends his children to get roots,
11   which are rolled in the ashes of the wife and become guts. He slaps himself, and
camas appears.   On the following day Coyote tries in vain to imitate him.

12. COYOTE AND BUFFALO 1 (2 versions: Nos. 6 and 47). First Version.-Coyote finds  12
the skull of a buffalo bull. He kicks it. After a while he hears a noise and sees
Buffalo coming in pursuit. His manitous hide him in the stump of a burnt tree,
which the Buffalo shatters; next in a stone, which he also shatters; in a pond, which 13
Buffalo drinks; in a rose bush, which Buffalo can not tear to pieces. Coyote asks for
peace and offers to smoke with Buffalo. Buffalo says that he lights his pipe by holding it up to the sun. Buffalo's wife had been taken away by other Buffaloes, and he 14
had been killed. Coyote sharpens Buffalo's horns, and the two set out to recover
Buffalo's wives. They overcome the other Buffaloes, and Coyote receives the larger
Buffalo Cow, which is to be his wife. He sends her ahead, and tries to shoot her in a
valley. The arrow does not enter her body. Finally he kills her. After butchering 15
her, he sits on a stone. Wolf comes and eats the Buffalo, and Coyote is unable to get
up until the meat has been eaten.2 He pounds the bones and tries to extract the
marrow. A bird tells him that he must not pound them,3 that Badger is to do so.
While Badger is pounding, Coyote is asked to take hold of Badger's tail.
The marrow is put into a bladder. Badger runs away, eats it, and throws back the
empty bladder. Coyote intends to break the remaining bones, and is told by a bird
that the bird will do it. Coyote is sent away and told to return when he sees smoke.  16
When he returns, the birds have flown away with what remains of the Buffalo,
Second Version.-Coyote finds the head of a Buffalo Bull,' passes it three times, and  61
breaks it with a stone. He covers a flat rock with his blanket, and lies down singing.
He hears Buffalo coming in pursuit. He runs away. When he is tired, he calls on
his manitous. The first one has the form of a stump, in which Coyote hides. Buffalo
breaks it in two. The next one is a stone, which Buffalo also breaks in two. The
third one is a bush, which Buffalo can not tear. They make peace and smoke together.  63
Coyote institutes the peace pipe. Buffalo tells Coyote that other Buffaloes took away
his two wives and killed him. Coyote sharpens Buffalo's horns, and they overcome
the other Buffaloes and take back the two wives. Buffalo gives to Coyote one of his
wives, which Coyote selects because she is not as strong as the other one. Coyote
sends his Buffalo wife ahead and kills her. He sits down on a stone and cries for the  65
wife whom he has killed. Wolves come and eat the Cow, while Coyote is unable to
get up.2 After the Wolves have disappeared, the stone lets him go. He is about to
break the bones to extract the marrow, when Badger forbids him to break the bones,
and offers to break them himself. Coyote holds on to Badger's tail while Badger is
pounding the bones. Badger puts the marrow into the bladder and runs away with
the marrow, eating it. He throws back the bladder. Coyote intends to pound the
remaining bones. Two birds forbid him to do so, and tell him that they themselves
will pound them. Coyote is sent to make a spoon. When he comes back, the birds
fly away with the chopped bone.
13. COYOTE AND BUTTERFLY (No. 17).-Coyote hears Butterfly singing. (The story  16
is unintelligible.)
14. COYOTE AND GROUSE 4 (No. 8).-While Grouse and husband are away, Coyote   17
enters the tent, puts their children into a bag, and carries them away. The children
break the bag and escape.

thinks she has been dead for a long time.
19    17. COYOTE AND THE MANITOU WITH THE hIAT 2 (No. 11).-Coyote meets a manitou
whose hat is made of fat. He eats of it and hurts the manitou.
19     18. COYOTE AND THE DUCKS (3 vcrsions: Nos. 12, 59, and VAEU 23:167). First Version.-Coyote and his two children reach a lake on which there are many ducks. He
tells his children to wail for his brother-in-law. A Mallard Duck comes ashore to
hear what is going on. The others follow, and Coyote pulls out their feathers.3
161     Second Version.-Coyote tells his son to wail for his brother-in-law.     The Ducks

Coyote stretches a net across the connecting river and induces the Ducks to swim.
Then he catches them, takes them home, and dries them. The surviving Ducks
165  discover what he is doing and fly away.     Lynx steals Coyote's ducks, and pulls his
face and his tail long. When Coyote discovers this, and when he overtakes Lynx
while asleep, he takes back the ducks and pushes in his tail andface.4
Third Version.-In this version the tale forms an incident of the tale of Coyote and
Dog. (See p. 299.)

Second Version.-Owl carries the children away in a bark basket, the inside of which    37
is set with awls. Coyote pretends to be a child, and is carried away by an Owl. He
sends the children to get gum.   Owl dances; and when he gets hot, Coyote gums up        38
his eyes and burns him. The ashes are transformed into owls.
Third Version.-Coyote transforms himself into a child.       When he cries, he is      51
thrown out of the tent, and Owl carries him along. He induces Owl to dance, and
kills him.
20. COYOTE AND TROUT (No. 25).-In winter Coyote meets a Trout Woman, marries           38
her, and follows her into the water, which they reach by jumping into a water hole.
The Trout goes to a place where people are fishing, saying that there is much food
there. Coyote breaks the hook. The people make a large hook, by means of which           39
they pull him out of the water. When he is all out, the people club him. He shouts,
saying that he is not a trout, but Coyote. He resumes his former shape.
21." COYOTE AND CARIBOU (No. 35).-Caribou grows fat by eating young grass. When        51
he is fat, Coyote kills him and then mourns for him.
22. COYOTE AND DEER (No. 37).-Coyote intends to kill Deer, and in pursuing him         51
is frightened by the wind. He kills Deer, who is holding his own head. He asks
whether he is holding Deer's father's war bonnet. The story is not by any means clear.
23. COYOTE'S CONTESTS 1 (No. 49).-The people of several towns have killed              69
Coyote's relatives.  Coyote asks Woodpecker, Flicker, Hawk, Chicken Hawk, and            71

Bluejay to accompany him and to have contests with these people. In the first town
they have a diving-contest, in which Duck is matched against Beaver. According
to Coyote's instruction, Duck hides under a canoe and breathes through a knot hole.
After Beaver has come up, Duck comes up too. In the second town they have a
wrestling-match.  Flicker wrestles with Kneecap and is almost defeated. Hawk
sends his supernatural power to help Flicker. When Kneecap is almost overcome,
73 Flicker finishes the contest alone. In a third town they have an eating-match, which
is won by Bluejay. Then Coyote and his friends begin to quarrel, each wanting to
go to a different place. Coyote wants to go to swamps, Duck to lakes, Flicker to dry
trees, Woodpecker to thick woods, Hawk to scattered trees. They separate accordingly.
127    24. COYOTE AND DOG (2 versions: No. 56 and VAEU 23:167).-Coyote's wife, Dog,
and her two children, cut fuel. When the tree falls, a deer jumps out, which Dog
holds. The children call Coyote to kill it. When they call him, he spills the rose
hips on which they are living, makes a bow, and goes to shoot the deer. He tramps
129 down the snow and tells Dog to let go of the deer. His first arrow passes over the
deer, which breaks through the snow. The second one passes under it. The deer
escapes. Coyote travels along on his snowshoes, and finds that they are full of shrews,
which he roasts. Dog is carrying her daughter on her back. She sees the fire, and
131 thinks that Coyote has killed the deer. Dog and her daughter leave Coyote and his
son. Coyote reaches a lake and catches young beavers, which he ties to his son as
ear ornaments. While he is away, the beavers revive, and drag the boy into the water.
133 Coyote returns to save the boy, and kills the beavers. He gives the beaver fat to his
son, while he eats the meat, but afterwards he exchanges meat and fat. Coyote plays
sliding down a hill. While he is doing so, his son freezes to death.1 On going on, he
135 comes to a town in which he finds a woman and her child. The child knows his
thoughts. He discovers that the child is his grandson. He rejoins his wife, the Dog.
When the hunters return in the evening with venison, Coyote enters the tent; but
137 they pretend not to see him, and soil his blanket. When he returns, his wife tells
him that only hunters are allowed to take part in the evening meal. On the following
day he joins them, and says he will kill two bucks and a grizzly bear with seven young
ones. When they are out, Coyote sits down at the head of the line of hunters. The
people claim that this is improper, because he has not obtained any game. The
chief of the hunters, Sun, carries pitchwood for starting a fire. Coyote puts flicker
feathers in his moccasin, and when he runs fire starts. He surrounds the deer with
139 fire and kills them. The hunters say that every hunter must carry his own game.
Coyote calls his manitous, who tell him that the hunters blow on their game to make
it small. He does the same, and carries home seven bears and two bucks. When he
kicks the game into the tent, it assumes its natural size. In the evening he does not
join tne feasters until his wife tells him that he may go. In the Sun's tent he sees a
shield (drying-frame?), which he steals. After walking a long distance, he lies down
141 to sleep, and on the following morning finds that he is back in the Sun's tent. This is
repeated until the Sun tells him that he must walk a whole day and a whole night
before lying down.2
(167) Second Version (VAEU 23).-Coyote's wife, Dog, goes gathering wood and catches
a deer. She sends her daughter to Coyote to kill it. Coyote has no arrows, and makes
two. He travels slowly because the snow is deep. He tells his wife to let go of the
(168) deer. He misses it. He tells his wife that they will pursue the deer, and asks her to
follow. The woman packs up the tent and follows. Coyote feels that his snowshoes are heavy, and finds that they are full of mice, which he fries. He gives one

pile to his wife and daughter, and keeps another for himself and son. The dog and
her daughter desert him. She goes to the Sun, who marries the daughter. Coyote
consoles his son, saying that Dog will come back when she has nothing to eat. He
catches beavers, and uses two young beavers as ear ornaments for his son. He goes
to get wood. The beavers revive and pull the boy into the water. Coyote rescues
him. He goes with his son to a place where two lakes are, connected by a small river.
He cries, sitting on the shore of the lake. The Ducks ask him why he is crying. The
Ducks offer to play with him. They dive and fly from one lake to the other. In
this game Coyote is almost drowned. In order to take revenge, he splits a tree and
spreads it. Thus he places it in the river. He tells the ducks to swim from one river
to the other, and every day a few are caught in the trap.' Coyote takes them to his
tent and singes off the feathers. Lynx smells the burning feathers, causes Coyote
to sleep, steals the ducks, and pulls out the nose and legs of Coyote and of his son,
In return Coyote and his son kick in Lynx'sface and break his tail.2  Lynx isfrightened
and runs away. Coyote goes to search for his wife, and finds her in the Sun's house.
His daughter is holding an ugly child, which hears his thoughts when he thinks
that the child is ugly. He wishes to kick the child. The child moves, and thus
produces a gale, which starts their fire. The hunters come back, and all the women
must leave before they begin to eat. Coyote is also sent away because he has not been
out hunting. When he does not go, the hunters soil his blanket and do not give
him anything to eat. The woman feeds him. Sun is blind. Wolf tries to restore
her eyesight, and after four attempts he succeeds. On the following day Coyote joins
the hunters, who go out carrying torches. Coyote does not carry any fire. When he
puts feathers into his snowshoes, he produces fire with every step. The chief tests
the running-powers of men by letting two run in a circle in opposite directions. Coyote
kills seven grizzly bears and two deer. The hunters shake the game in order to make
it small, and leave him. Coyote learns from his dung advisers what to do with the (170)
animals. He blows on them, and they shrink. He puts them into his belt and runs
home. He is allowed to eat with the hunters. One day he leaves in order to visit
his son. He steals the Sun's torch. After walking some distance, he lies down to
sleep; and when he awakes, he finds he is back in the Sun's house. After this has
happened three times, the Sun tells him that he must run for three days and three
nights without stopping, and then the Sun will not return to him.
25. COYOTEF AND Fox 3 (No. 58).-Coyote and Fox send their sons to obtain super- 143
natural power. Coyote's son returns soon; Fox's son stays away the whole night. 145
The one receives as his power moonlight; the other, darkness.4 The two boys go to
a village in which the people play with a hoop. Young Coyote wants to steal it;
Young Fox wants to wait until morning. When Young Fox is ready to start, Young
Coyote is asleep. The hoop is in a tent in which two people stand watching the doorway, each holding a hammer.5 The two pass, take the hoop, which touches the
doorway a little and makes a sound. The two old people awake and call the other 147
people, who pursue the boys. Young Coyote carries the hoop. When he becomes
tired, he gives it to Young Fox. ~ Young Coyote is caught, and the people say they
will not kill him. Young Fox rolls the hoop ahead and sings, saying that Young
Coyote has been killed. Old Coyote understands that Young Fox has been killed.
The hoop rolls into the tent, and falls down where Coyote is sitting. Then he knows 149
that his own son has been captured. Old Coyote and Fox make war on the people

who have captured Young Coyote. They find the people using Young Coyote in place
151 of their hoop. Fox makes a sign to him, and Young Coyote runs away and makes
his escape.
Salmon hears about the hoop, and tries to win it by gambling with Coyote. Coyote
and his partner Young Fox lose the hoop. Coyote sends Young Fox to Old Fox to
153 borrow his partridge tail. Fox plays with Young Coyote as partner against Salmon,
and wins back what Coyote has lost. Salmon loses his daughter, who is then married
to Young Coyote.
The couple have a child. They travel in their canoe to the Salmon country. Fox
155 accompanies them. The woman is seated in the bow of the canoe. They reach a
dangerous place. Fox, Coyote, and his son enter a bladder. Fox has his pipe1 in
the hole of the bladder. The canoe upsets above the falls and sinks; but they come
up unharmed below the falls, drifting down in the bladder. The same happens at
another place.
When they reach the Salmon country, the woman climbs a steep precipice, on which
she hopes to kill Coyote and Fox. Fox throws tobacco on it, and they are able to
climb it. The woman asks her elder brother to kill Fox and Coyote. He throws dog
manure into the fire in order to suffocate them, but Fox saves them in his bladder.2
157 They are sent out to fish salmon during the night. Coyote stays behind in the tent,
and is warned not to fall asleep, because the people will kill him. He is also told to
come out if he shou ld see a small fire, which would indicate that Fox and Coyote were
fighting with the Salmon people. Two old persons stand in the doorway; and when
Coyote sees the light of the canoe getting small, he rushes out. Coyote deceives the
old people, who kill each other with their hammers. Coyote goes aboard the canoe.
159   The woman's brother transforms himself into a salmon. A Salmon boy, who accompanies them, moves his torch so that Fox shall not hit the salmon with his spear.
The boy tells Fox to strike the salmon tail. If he should have done so, the salmon
would have upset the canoe. Fox knows this, and strikes the stomach of the salmon.
They cut off its head. Coyote is told not to took back. He disobeys, and the canoe
can not be moved. The pursuers are satisfied when Fox throws the salmon head into
161 the water, and the canoe moves on.
The people are sent to dive for the salmon head, and the one who succeeds in getting it is promised the Salmon chief's daughter.3 Turtle succeeds, and marries the
girl, who refuses to talk. When he makes her laugh by tickling her, he finds that her
mouth has a foul smell, and he leaves her.
165   26. COYOTE KILLS PANTHER AND LIBERATES THE SALMON (No. 60).-Coyote's wife,
Dog, sends him to visit Panther. He finds him engaged in making arrows, while his
167 wife is cleaning skins. They refuse to give him food. He sends his wife, telling her
that their meat is hanging close to the doorway. Panther scolds her. When she
returns, Coyote makes a bow for himself and his son, and a hammer for his wife and
169 his daughter. They attack Panther, and eventually kill him and his family. They
skin them and throw the bodies out of the tent.
Coyote acts as Panther used to do: he calls the game, which appears, and which
he shoots. Since he shoots too much, the game disappears, except two animals.
The animals suffer, and say that they recognize that it is Coyote who has shot too
many of them. They send Little Flathorn, who discovers the bodies of the Panthers.
171 The animals make war on Coyote. They throw stones down from the mountains.
Coyote paints himself and puts on his war dress. His wife and his children are killed
by the stones, and finally he himself is hit.

He transforms himself into a plank 1 and drifts down the river.   He lands at a fish
trap. Two girls find him and carry him to the tent. 'hen they put fish on the plank,
it eats the fish.  They recognize that he is Coyote, and throw him into the water.      173
He sees two girls picking berries, and transforms himself into an infant, which they
carry home. The girls stay at home, watching the child. Coyote sees that when one
of the girls stretches her hand backward, salmon fall down; and that when the other
one stretches out her hands, a fawn falls down. When the berries are all eaten, they
deliberate whether they may leave the child alone and tell him to put out the fire.
Since he is able to do so, they go out. When the girls are gone, he discovers the
salmon and fawns behind the tent. He digs a ditch to the river. On the following        175
day he completes the ditch and drives the salmon into the river. He throws the
fawn into the fire and leaves it. He sets fire to the house. When the girls come
back, they find the salmon gone. They think that the bones in the fireplace are
those of the child.  Finally they recognize that they have been fooled by Coyote, and
ask him to leave some food. He shakes his blanket, and a few of the salmon turn back.
He meets Wolverene, who is fishing. Wolverene's sister announces his arrival;
and Wolverene says that the visitor is Coyote, and asks her not to look at him. For
this reason Coyote does not give them salmon. He meets Sparrow, who is fishing.         177
When his arrival is announced, Sparrow accepts him, and his daughter marries him.
Therefore he leaves salmon there. On the following morning he tells the salmon to
go into the fish trap, first one, then two, then three, and finally many.  Coyote leaves  179
his wife, and closes the passage between Columbia Lakes and Kootenai River.
27. ORIGIN OF THE SEASONS 2 (No. 61).-Coyote goes to Squirrel to ask for food.
She has no more, and tells him that spring is still far away. He tells her what to do. 181
Squirrel cries, and says there will be no food until spring. The seasons are kept in
another town; and after twelve months of winter, the owners untie the bag containing
spring, summer, and fall. The people start to steal the summer season. They go to
a town in the sky, and Lynx is sent ahead to enter the tent. The people are placed
outside at intervals, the strongest one farthest away from the tent.3 The Lynx boy
goes into the tent, and two old women tell him where the springtime is hanging. He
heats some gum by the fire; and when it is melted, he sticks it on the mouths of the
old women. Then he takes down the bag containing the spring. The women can
not speak, but finally the people discover that the bag containing the spring is being

217   into Magpie's eyes.    Therefore magpies' eyes water. The people send Jack Rabbit
(Dog?) and Hare to look for game. They reach a tent inhabited by two old women.
They see the tracks of buffaloes. The one transforms herself into a pup; the other one,
into a stone. The dog lies down near a water hole. One of the old women wants to
throw the pup into the water; the other one pities the pup and takes it home. The
other woman takes the stone home in order to use it as an anvil. A bladder and a
bunch of claws are hanging in the doorway. When the buffaloes come in, these two
give notice by their noise. At night the one boy breaks the bladder with a stick;
the other one steals the claws. When the boys are some distance away, they shake the
219   claws and sing, calling the buffaloes. The game runs out of the tent. The women
find that the bladder is broken and the rattle taken away. The women with lifted
hammers stand by the side of the trail of the game. The two youths hang on with
their teeth to the testicles of a buffalo bull. The women strike it, and make its sides flat.
All the pemmican in the house rolls out. Thus the game is secured by the people.

picks huckleberries. A sea monster abducts her.' Chicken Hawk shoots the monster, which drinks all the water.2    When Chicken Hawk pulls out his arrow, the
water streams out,3 and there is a deluge. Chicken Hawk takes off his tail and puts
it up, saying that if the water rises higher than the stripes on his tail the people will
die. The water stops before reaching the last stripe, and then goes down again.4
219     Second Version.-Chicken Hawk's wife. Grouse. picks huckleberries. When swim221  ming in a lake, the water monster threatens to kill her. She pours the huckleberries
into its mouth. When she goes home, she pretends to have been unable to pick
huckleberries because she felt ill. When she goes out again, she meets the sea monster,
who becomes her lover. When going home, she pretends to be sick. Finally Chicken
223  Hawk goes out to watch her. He sees her with the sea monster. When his wife
comes home, he tells her that the huckleberries are bad, and asks her to wash them.
On the following day Chicken Hawk follows her, and shoots the water monster with
one of his two arrows. With the other one he shoots his wife, whom he transforms into
a grouse. The water monster goes back into the lake and drinks lake and rivers.
225  Then he dies. The people almost die of thirst. Chicken Hawk pulls out the arrow,
and the people are able to drink again. The water rises, and the people climb the
mountains. He places his tail upright, and says that if the water should pass the
third stripe of the tail the world would come to an end. The water stops rising before
reaching the last stripe, and goes down again.

and finds it contains bear hair with which he was to be poisoned. Bear sees this
and rushes after them. He kills the brothers. Only Mink survives. Mink makes a
small pit and throws something into it, which is transformed into a girl. He throws
(171) her away. He repeats this experiment, and finds a boy, whom he raises. When he
sees the Bear on the other side of the river, he jumps into the water. The Bear tries
to get him, makes a raft, drifts down the river. Here Mink kills him. He meets
Bear's brothers, transforms himself into a fly, but is seen by the Bears. Then he
transforms himself into a very small fly, which the Bear swallows without noticing it.
He kills the Bear with his knife.1 At Bonner's Ferry he builds a salmon weir under
an overhanging rock. Every day the weirs are found empty, except that of Mink.
The people see a meteor coming down, which empties the weirs. The meteor is a
basket. The thieves leave the basket and carry the fish back. The animals discover
that the rope by which the meteor is let down is a snake. Owl and Lynx cut the
snake. They find that in the basket there are a buffalo, a mountain goat, a frog, and
a turtle. These are transformed into stones. The people try to kill the frog by striking it with sticks, but they are unable to do so. For this reason the place is named
Strong Belly.
225   42. WOLF (No. 67).-Wolf is married to Doe. He does not like the moccasins that
227 his wife makes, and therefore goes to,fight his brothers-in-law. The Buck hides his
wife and son in a hole, and transforms himself into a deer. He goes up a mountain.
The Wolves kill the people, but can not find Wolf's brother-in-law. Wolf follows the
tracks of his brother-in-law; but whenever he reaches one mountain, Buck is on the
following one. Finally Buck goes to his father's father, the fish K!/k!om', who is
229 smoking. The Fish throws his mittens on the Buck, and thus hides him. Wolf
enters Fish's tent, but does not see his brother-in-law. He asks for him, but the Fish
denies having seen him. Fish makes the figure of a deer of grass, throws it out of the
smoke hole, and it becomes a deer, which stands on the other side of the river. When
Wolf sees it, he swims across the river in order to get it. Then the Fish launches his
231 canoe and goes aboard with Buck. They catch up with Wolf and kill him.
43. SKUNK 2 (No. 68).-Skunk and his younger brother Fisher live in one tent;
Frog and his granddaughters Chipmunk and Big Chipmunk, in another one. The
Chipmunks want to get meat; and Frog sends them to Fisher, but warns them to
beware of Skunk. She tells them that Fisher always gets home in the evening. The
girls wait at some distance from the tent. Skunk causes his guardian spirit to pound
bones in the tent, while he himself goes out dressed like Fisher. Big Chipmunk
233 insists that the person who came out is Fisher, and finally persuades her elder sister
to go in with her. When Fisher comes home, he sends Skunk for water. Skunk is
afraid to go far away, and goes to his own spring. Fisher sends him back to get water
from his spring 3 and to bring in the game. He gives him a tump-line made of entrails.4
235 Skunk is afraid that Fisher may take the girls, but has to go. Fisher causes a gale to
overtake Skunk. The tump-line breaks repeatedly, and he is almost frozen to death.
Meanwhile Fisher finds the girls, and with them leaves the tent. He tells them to

remove all the rotten bones, because one of these is Skunk's guardian. They go
first to Chipmunk's hole, then to Big Chipmunk's, but both are too small. They
climb a tree at the place where Fisher lives. When Skunk succeeds in getting home,
he finds the tent empty, and after searching finds a single rotten bone that Big Chipmunk had left. Then he pursues the fugitives. By means of the bone, which is            237
his guardian spirit, he finds the tree. He shoots it with his fluid, and it falls.1 Fisher
and his wife jump to another tree, but finally they fall down and are killed. Skunk
restores the sisters, and they go to Big Chipmunk's tent. It is too small, but by
shooting his fluid into it he enlarges it. They sleep in the tent. When Skunk is
sound asleep, the women leave him and go to search for Fisher. They reduce the          239
size of the tent by means of their supernatural power, so that it becomes as small as
before. They restore Fisher to life and move away. When Skunk is awakened; he
finds himself in the narrow hole, unable to move. He succeeds in enlarging it a
little by means of his fluid, and sees an opening. He pushes out his musk bag at the
end of his bow; and Raven, who happens to fly by, takes it away. Skunk cuts off         241
his legs and his arms,2 and puts one part of his body after another out of the hole. When
outside, he puts himself together, but parts of his entrails have been lost. He puts
leaves in their place. Raven takes the musk bag to his village. He transforms it 243
into a pup, and they play with it. Skunk reaches the village and is given food, which,
however, falls right through him. He goes out, and sees the children playing with
the pup. He makes signs to it, and the pup runs towards him. It is retransformed
into his musk bag, which he takes away.3
44. THE STAR HUSBAND 4 (No. 70).-Two girls sleep outside and see many stars. 247
One of them says that she wants to marry a small star that she sees there. When she
wakes, she finds herself sitting next to an old man, who tells her that he is the star.
The large stars are young men; the small stars, old ones. She goes out digging roots, 249
-and against the commands of the people breaks the ground near a tree. She can look
down, and sees her relatives walking about. She makes a rope and lets herself down.
At home she tells what has happened, and on the following morning she is found dead,
killed by the star.

her how it happens that her son is so white. She tells him that she cooked him in
45 order to make him white. He asks to be treated in the same way, and is killed.
(171) Second Version.-A woman has gone out berrying, and puts her child down in the
grass. A giant steps up to her and asks why the child, whom he calls his brother,
is so white. The woman says that this is the result of roasting. The giant asks to

lights the fire, and kills him.-A giant who sits on the bank of a river is overtaken
by some boys, who kill him by shooting him from behind.
83   46. THE GIANT (2 versions: Nos. 51 and 76). First Version.-Two brothers go out
hunting. The elder one shoots a bighorn sheep. He starts a fire, and dries the meat
over the fire. He roasts a piece of the meat, and does not like the taste. Then he
cuts a piece of flesh from his body, roasts it, and likes the taste. He eats himself
entirely. The younger brother goes out to search after him. He sees a fire, and hears
his brother saying, "I love my brother, and it will take me two days to eat him."
The transformed brother pursues him, strikes him with his intestines, and kills him.
The elder brother's wife goes out to search for her husband. Something tells her to
85 put sharp stones on her clothing. She does so. The man strikes her with his intestines, but tears them. She runs home and tells the people what has happened. They
move camp. The man's wife and his son alone remain. Crane stays near by. The
transformed man comes. He takes the child and tears it in two. The woman offers
to wash it, goes out, and runs away. She tells the people what has happened. Crane

place, and Crane kicks him into the water, where he is drowned.
273   Second Version.-A young man goes hunting sheep and dries the meat. Suddenly
he sees two slices of meat, which he eats and which he likes. When he sits down, he
feels a pain, and sees that he has eaten of his own flesh. He cuts one piece after
275 another from his body until only bones and intestines remain. After three days one
of his elder brothers goes to look for him. When he finds him, the transformed brother
says that he loves him, but kills and eats him. Thus he kills all his brothers. The
277 youngest one is warned by his guardian spirit. The boy makes his escape, and tells
the people to leave. The hunter's wife stays behind with her son. When the man
arrives, he holds his son tightly and makes him dance. The woman pretends that

into a charr. The first time he strikes it, it iswood; the second time, it is a fish. In the
evening they reach the village of their enemies. Two scouts, Lamb Hat and Raven 255
Hat, go out and see the village of the enemy. The people (except one man, who is
suspicious) think they are animals. Lamb Hat transforms himself into a lamb, and 257

runs back along a ledge upon which they are standing. The enemies pursue them,
and the friends reach an old man named Pine Cone, who is hunting muskrats. They
warn him, but he disbelieves them. When he sees the enemies coming, he hides, and 265
puts his blanket over a figure made of rushes, intending to deceive the enemies. The
enemies find him, and he tries to shoot them. His arrows hit them, but do not pierce
them. His last arrow has no point, and with it he kills one of the enemies, who then
attack him. He tries to ward off their arrows with his bow, but is killed. The enemies go back. When the people of the two friends reach the lake, they find the body
of Pine Cone.

IV. VOCABULARY
The following vocabulary contains a selection of the more important stem-words, prefixes, and suffixes, together with examples showing the use of these stems. So far as possible. these examples have
been taken from the texts. The Kutenai-English vocabulary has
been arranged in such order that sounds which are closely related
stand near together. The order selected is, vowels, labials, dentals,
palatals, velars, laterals. This results in the following order of
sounds:
a        y     p      t      c      I
L,  i      w.    p!     t!    7c!
o, u, hv         m       s
ts     q!
ts!    x
n
The long lists of nouns beginning with aak7- have been placed
together. I have embodied in- this list a long list of nouns collected by Dr. Chamberlain, which I have not checked. I have
kept these separate, because it is impossible to distinguish between
akic-, aa.k!-, aa'q-, aa'.!-.
In the verbal forms I have generally given the stem without
ending and without prefix. This is indicated by hyphens at the
beginning and at the end of the word. Prefixes have been marked
by a following hyphen and the abbreviation pr., although they
may also take verbal prefixes. Suffixes have been marked by a
preceding hyphen and the abbreviation suff. References are to
page and line of the preceding texts; 256.161, for instance, means
p. 256, line  161. Words marked Kel. -were obtained from     a
young Lower Kutenai named James Keluwat; those marked Aitken
were collected by Mr. Robert T. Aitken, who accompanied me part
of the time I spent among the Kutenai.
