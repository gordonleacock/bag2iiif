The Meeting was opened with prayer by the President.
The oath of office having been administered by Hon. E. Lawrence, Circuit Judge of th'e  ourth Judicial District, the President addressed the Board as follovws
' Inasmuch as I meet all of you but one now for the first time, as
members of the Board of Regents, it would seem appropriate
for me, as ex officio President of the Board, to offer to you a
few words of greeting, and tender to you, in behalf of the University, an expression of confidence in your wisdom and your
earnest devotion to its highest good. For the second time since

the University has been under the control of a Board of Regents
elected by the people according to a provision of the Constitution of the State, all its members, newly elected, hold what
may be called their first meeting, though legally, the Board
itself in name, authority and functions, is not changed. The
Constitution recognizes but one Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, and has made provision that it may never
expire, but be always full. Hereafter, also, as you are well
aware, by a change in the time of electing the several Regentsf
it has been provided that the entire membership shall not be
elected at once.
" I am glad to be able to announce, not as a mere matter of
form,,but as a fact, that the University in all its departments at
once was never before so largely attended, perhaps never so prosperous as now. The great increase in the Literary Department
has not quite brought that Department up to what it was
five years ago, but as a whole, the University is much more
numerously attended than ever before. It has passed through
its childhood, its formative stage, and has acquired a steady
usefulness. Henceforth it must not'be expected to grow rapidly,
but, like the leading universities of our oldest states, to meet a
constant demand, and produce a constant good result. Gradual
and permanent improvements may also be hoped for.
4 Our greatest immediate necessity is a new or enlarged building for the Department of Medicine and Surgery. This flourishing 'Department has literally outgrown its accommodations.
The laws of hygiene are daily violated by the crowded state of
the rooms in which those laws are explained. It is literally impossible for the Professors to do justice to themselves, or to
their cause, or to the students, without ampler and better accommodations. The Regents have succeeded within the past
two years in erecting a commodious building for the Law Department and the General Library, without a special grant from
the State, and without encroaching upon the ordinary workings of the University. This, however, is not entirely paid for.
I hope that you will find, on careful examination, that you can

meet the liabilities for this building, and also provide for the
erection of an addition to the Medical College.
" Other improvements are much needed in the University, such
as the establishment of a professorship of Hebrew and Oriental
Languages, a professorship of Political Economy, the establish.
ment of a Gymnasium, or making some provision for a due attention to physical education. But our only safe course is to
attempt only what we are sure that we can accomplish. At
present I cannot recommend for immediate action any great ex
penditure, except what may be needed for the Medical Building.
" The true pecuniary eondition of this University ought to be
well known to the people of the state. It is not abundantly
wealthy, as some think. While it has property enough, by
strict economy, to present the advantages of a genuine university, fally satisfying the desires of the eight hundred students
that now attend it, still there are essential elements of a thorough university that it cannot yet command.  Nor will it ever
bj able to do so probably, without additional public aid, and also
donations from the friends of education, such as have been received by Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and other of our oldest
universities. The example has already been set in this State,
and I hope will be frequently followed. The Observatory on
yonder hill, furnished to us by a few liberal friends of science in
Detroit, has already made this University known all over the
civilized world. Shall we not yet see professorships established,
scholarships endowed, libraries replenished, and other agencies
furnished, by intelligent, able benefactors, and by a liberal state,
for the perfection of this great central University for the Northwest?  But, Gentlemen, I will not enlarge upon this prolific
theme.
" Allow me to mention that a proper care for the buildings and
grounds and interests of the University requires that the Steward
should have a sufficient compensation to make it his duty to have
an office in one of the buildings, and spend several hours a day
upon the ground. The economy of such an arrangement is too evi

dent to need argument, Several other little changes and provisions have been suggested by members of the Faculty, which
I may take occasion to present.
"I cannot doubt that it is the anxious desire of the truest
friends of the University of Michigan, that, under your supervision it may become more and more evident that a State University can be strong and permanent, not torn by political
factions, and yet soundly loyal and outspoken in its inculcation
of fidelity to the country; not the prey of sectarian jealousyif such a thing still exists-and yet truly Christian in theory and
practice. That is my desire and aim; that I believe to be the
ambition of its able Faculty. None of us should be allowed by
you to remain here any longer than we can enjoy your confidence, as doing all that can be expected and secured for the
accomplishment of such a result. That this may be our experience has already been my prayer, and shall, I trust, be our
united endeavor."
On motion of Regent Johnson the following report of the
Board of State Canvassers was ordered to be entered at length
upon the Journal:

of the present buildings —aiter the completion of said building,
shall be set apart as a fund to repay, on the first day of April. of

ceived that full and careful,consideration on the part of the
Committee, to which, from their,character and source they
were deemed to be entitled.
Your Conmittee regret that -anything should have occurred in the history of the University, which should awaken
the fears and apprehensions of persons of such distinguished respectability and influence as thos whose names are appended to
these nmemorials, and also sincerely join with them in the further
regret that any circumstances should have arisen which should
deprive the University and the educational interests of the:
State, of the services of one whose superior ability and attainments, and whose efficiency and success in the sphere filled by
limin with such rare distinction' have for some years past been
an honor to our State.
They appreeiate, and believe that the ieople of the State apprecia'te the labors of that eminent scholar and educator, and
the impress which his influence has 'eft upon our young and
rapidly developing Commonwealth.
They recognize as fully as the memorialitsts tke almost unexampled prosperity of the University during the Presidency of
Dr. Tappan, and accord to him and to his co-adjutors in the
management of tle several departments, within that period, the
distinguislled merit of having placed the institution among those
of the very first rank in our country, whether we regard its discipline, the character and grade of the scholarship attained, or
the number of students whom it has yearly sent forth so well
fitted for the duties and responsibilities of active life.
The action of the late Board of Regents relrehended by
some of the memorialists, your Committee would perhaps be
stepping aside from their province if they should presume in this
report either to endorse or condemn. They do not regard it to
be the duty of the present Board of Regents to sit in judgement
upon their predecessors in office, but believe that accepting the
University as they find it, it is required at their hands to admini;ter the trust as the best interests of the institution shall appear
to them to demand. Such is the estimatin n which your Com

mittee hold the ability and scholarship of the late President)
they would be glad if, consistent with these interests, they could
recommiend his recall to his former position. But after the most
careful deliberation they have come to the conclusion that it is
impracticable, and believe tehat in the posture which affairs have
assumned, such an act would prove injurious to the real welfare of
the Universitv,which welfare they deem to be the legitimate subject of consideration for the Board of Regents, on the question
presented by the memorialists.
The assumption made by a portion of those who have memorialized the Board, that the University is not at present in
good condition, and does not give promise of success, appears to.your Committee to have been made without sufficient knowledge of the facts. The pressure upon the Board from the differ-,ent departments for increased facilities for the accommodation of
students, is a proof that the institution is not languishing. The
Law and Medical departments especially, under the more immec
diate direction of their several faculties, are flourishing to a degree not before paralleled since they were established.  The
iyiterary and Scientific departments give no signs of that decadience mentioned by the mernorialists. Apparently the institution is prosperous; and there is a good degree of harmony in
the several departments, and among the various faculties, and
from what we can learn, after the most deliberate examination
and survey, the conviction is forced upon us unanimously that,
under all the circumstances of the case, such a change as is sought
by the memorialists, would be attended with a disturbance of
that harmony greater than has yet existed in the University.
The charge is made in several of the papers referred to your
Comrnittee, that the rules and regulations of the Board of Re-:gents confer duties asnd prerogatives belonging to the different
faculties and to the President, upon committees appointed by
the Board, and consisting mainly of members of the same. This,objection can no longer be urged, as the revised rules meet the
ulnanimous approbation, it is believed, of all the faculties of the
institution.
Your Committee feel constrained to recommend that the re

quest of the memorialists be. not granted.  In malking this
recommendation, they   submit the grave and important
question to the Board, and would here express the hope that
the conclusion which shall be finally reached may he such as
shall secure the acquiescence of every true fiiend of the Unriversity, and; that all strife and contention being laid aside,, the spirit of peace, and harmony, and mutual concession may prevail,
and that the institution which has justly been hitherto the
pride of the State, may go on, in its career of usefulness,
dispensing its blessings, and imparting a beneficial and- gracious
influence to all.
The report was adopted by the following vote:
Ayes —Regents Walker, Willard-, Gilbert, Johnson, Sweezey.
Noes-Regent Knight.
Absent-Regent Joslih.
Regent Johnson, in voting in the affirmative, wished an explanation recorded to the efiect that he concurred in most of the
sentiments expressed in the report, but did not concur in all of
them.
Regent Knight, in voting in the negative wished an explanation recorded to the effect that with a very large portion of
the report he cordially agreed, but could not vote in favor of
the adoption. o the report without apparently assenting to
opinions he didi not entertain; but he wished to be understood
as agreeing heartily, in the desire expressed, by the committee
for the continued growth and prosperity of our beloved University under the administration now fally insstallied by the afi!rmative action of this Bozredi.
On motion of Regent Wadllker, the C'onm-mttee on the Medical
Department was authorized to employ a suitable person to superintend the erection of the proposed addition to. the Miedical
building; provided that the contract is made for the erection of the same.

made for the property, and t'he Committee sold the same for
the sum o' $22,010 to Jacob S. Farrand and Alanson Sheley,
$6,010 cown,,and balance on five years' time, with annual interest, with the privilege of paving at anv time in sums of $1,000

The purchasers have sold a portion of the rear of said lot,
and wish to pirocure a release of the same fromn their mortgage
on paying to ithe -University the whole amount for which they
sell the same. There is no objection to granting this request,
as there will be nbundant security left in the hands of the University. WVherefore your Committee would recommend the
passage o  e the ollowing resolution:
Resolvecd, That the President and Secretary are hereby authorized to dischargoe the mortgage of Messrs. Farrand &amp; Sheley on the University lot in Detroit, when the same shall be paid
in full, and also to discharge from said mortgage a portion of
said lot, upon a partial payment thereon, at their discretion,
without in their opinion endangering the security of the remaining debt.

good and growing condition, as follows: 582 evergreens, 350
maple, 270 elm, 46 native forest oak, 35 horse-chestnut, 26 ash,
6 native forest hickory, 6 poplar, 6 catalpa, 6 butternut, 5 burroak, 2 dogwood, 5 apple, 5 cherry, 2 willow, 5 tulip, 2 sumac,
5 basswood, and 6 locust.
I have caused to be constructed about one hundred and fifty
rods of new gravel wa ks, four and six feet wide. Three hundred and fifty square yards of gravel have been placed around
the college buildings and dwelling-houses. The two long walks
leading from the northwest entrance to the Medical Laboratory,
Law, and Literary buildings, have been greatly improved by
taking up the one rotten plank and putting down instead four
six inch planks, which now afford ample room for two persons
to walk abreast, instead of one, as before. By direction of the
Executive Committee, I have caused the dwelling-houses to be
put in tenantable repair. The northwest dwelling particularly,
was very iuch out of repair. I have now to report the dwellings in good order. They are all rented, and produce an annual
incomle to the University of $1,000 for rents. The roofs will be
more or less troublesome on account of leaks. They are tin
(except tie President's house), and are old and rusty, and will
need constant watching. I have caused the leaks in the roofs
of the north and south Coilege buildings to be repaired.
I discovered, to my surprise, a serious leak in the tin portion
of the roof of the Law building. I at once caused it to be repaired in the best manner. I would recommend that all the tin
roofs shall be painted with some substantial rooffing paint, which
will, I think, preserve for a time, at least. The roofs of the
Laboratory and old Medical College buildings have been repaired and the dome painted. The monument which formerly
stood near the Laboratory, and in danger from the new Medical building, has been removed to a more suitable spot, about
ten rods north of its former position. It is now surrounded by
a fine growing elm and evergreen grove. I have caused the
iron gates to the principal entrance to be repaired and strengthened, so that they now work well. I have made an additional
warm air fnle to the south furnace in the Law building, leading
from the cellar to the main hall, which produces ten or twelve
degrees more beat in the ball,,ithout in the least diminishing

the supply to other parts of the building, but which actually
saves what would otherwise be lost. It may be well to make
the same improvement to the north furnace. The Moot Court
room has been fitted up with gas, platform, desk, etc., with but
little cost.
IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED.
A new fence, inclosing the entire grounds, is much needed.
The present one is rotten, and it is not safe. I have patched
and braced it until there is scarcely any more of the original
left to nail to.
The floors and steps in both the halls of the south College
building are worn out, and will not be safe to remain as they
now are another season. I have engaged two thousand feet of
ash flooring for this purpose, at a price much lower than that
for which the lumber can now be obtained. Other alterations and
repairs which properly belong to incidental expenses are needed. The old bell is used up; it is broken; it is not large
enough for the purpose. I have corresponded with the most
extensive bell manuliacturers in the United States (A. Meneely's
Sons, Troy, NT. Y.) as to the probable cost oi a new one of
about six or seven hundred lbs. The reply is in the hands of
the President, which will give the desired information. If a
new one should be decided upon, it should be placed on the
roof of the north College building, out of reach of harm. Other
alterations and repairs which are necessary are constantly occurring. Slate blackboards, which are considered the best, are
needed for several of the recitation rooms.
I have contracted for one hundred and fifty cords of wood at
four and a half and five dollars per cord, which, with what we
have on hand, will carry us well into 1865. We shall need one
hundred tons of coal for the Law, Meedical, and Laboratory
buildings. This will cost at present prices, delivered here, about
$14.50 per ton. I have several letters from dealers, which I
submit for your perusal.
The General Library room needs more shelving, to provide
for which I engaged three thousand feet of best oak lumber
(green), at a price far less than that for which it can now be
bought. I have fitted up the old shop, which answers as a kiln
to dry the lumber.
The entire wood-work in the museum needs painting. It has
not been painted for more than six years, perhaps for more than
ten years. I ask authority to have it properly put in order. I
have to report the buildings, with the exception of the repairs

It will be seen from the above that an extraordinary amount
of work has been done, and even had prices remained the same
as before, a much greater expenditure of money than ordinary
might have been expected. Some of the work had been ordered by the previous Board, whichl we have executed, and the
cost is charged in this year's account. I have advised with the
President and obtained his approval in carrying out -all this
work, and am confident that the most rigid economy has been
observed, and that the interest of the University has been promoted.

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT.
To the Honorable the JBoard of Regents:
GENTLEMEN: It is one of the duties of the President to make ah annual report to the Board, " embodying therein such suggestions and recommendations
as he may deem best for the management and improvement of the University.'
The year just dlosing has been one of more than ordinary anxiety to the
University, giving rise to much discussion of its interests among the people of
the State. It is gratifying, however, that all parties seem to have recognized
the great usefulness of the University, and a desire that it should be justly and
impartially managed. This interest from without has been responded to by
earnest united labor from within. Seldom in so large an institution have there
been so great unanimity of sentiment, and such hearty co-operation, as have
characterized the members of the several Faculties during the past year. As
a natural consequence it has been a year of great prosperity. Difficulties have
disappeared, and threatened evils have been changed into good.
The only true success of a University must result from the strength and united endeavor of its Faculty, and the abundance and variety of its aids to the investigation of truth. Where these elements of power exist, no great amount
of advertising is necessary, and no ordinary opposition can be permanently injurious; the people soon learn the facts and students in large numbers resort
to its halls.
During the past year no radical change has been attempted in organization

and management, but a general effort has been put forth to render the workings of the machinery as perfect as possible. The standard of scholarship required for admission to the Department of Science, Literature and the Arts, has
been kindly but honestly enforced, and a greater proportion of applicants than
heretofore have been refused for want of proper preparation. The standard for
admission has also been considerably raised, to apply in future years, as will
be seen in the statement published in the Catalogue; and heretofore none are
to be admitted even to pursue selected studies, or what have heretofore been
improperly called "the Optional Course," except such as are found, upon examination, qualified to enter the Freshman Class, either in the Classical or the
Scientific Course of Study. The increased number and the elevated standard of
our High Schools allow us to make this advancement, and though it may temporarily diminish the number of our students in the Department of Science,
Literature, and the Arts, it will enable us the more completely to accomplish
the true purposes of an American University.
No changes have taken place in the Faculty of this Department during the
year, except that Mr. E. H. Wells has been employed to assist in the Department
of Civil Engineering. Inasmuch as Prof. A. D. White was elected by his fellow citizens of the 22d Senatorial District of New York to represent them in
the Senate of that State, he found it impracticable to give any instruction in the
University during the past year, but an arrangement has been made by which
he will be able to deliver a course of lectures on History in the early part of
the succeeding year. I am glad that, notwithstanding the'pressure of his publie engagements, his interest iAl:he University, of which he has given such
abundant evidence heretofore, is unabated, and that the institution is not to
lose his valuable labors as a Professor. During his absence Mr. Charles K.
Adams has not only instructed the classes in History but also aided the Professor of Latin.
In the Medical and Law Departments, the Faculties have remained the same
as during the preceding year.
The number of students in each of the three Departments has been greater
than ever before, though the attendance at the beginning of the year was not
so prompt as is desirable.
In the Department of Science, Literature, and the Arts the number was 300.
The preceding year it was 266, though in 1859 the number was 287, nearly as
great as last year. The average number for the past eight years has been 270.
There can be no doubt that the number of students in this Department could
be greatly increased, if as in the Scotch Universities, no requirements for admission were insisted upon but good moral character and a certain age. Such
a course can be pursued in the other Departments of the University where the
studies are pursued principally by lectures, and where an abuse of the privilege

is prevented.by rigid examinations previous to graduation, but in this Depart.
ment, wisely, under the direction of the Regents, the Faculty insist upon a
thorough preparation. It is not merely numbers, but character, that we desire 
and it would not be becoming for the University to be giving to a large number
Ofyouth precisely the same kind and degree of instruction that can be furnished
as well in the other public schools of the State. Still an extreme position on this
subject is possible, and great care and soundjudgment will be requisite to secure
the proper course. From time to time the Courses of Study are modified as experience and circumstances suggest improvements, but the constant tendency is to
render all the aid that students can possibly enjoy, to pursue the various
branches of a thorough liberal education.
In the Department of Medicine and Surgery the number of Students the last
year has been 350. The year previous it was 252, and the average for the last
eight years has been 224. Large as this number is, it will be observed that
the increase last year was very great.
The College Building of this Department is now greatly enlarged and improved. It had answered its purpose well for about fourteen years, but was no
longer able to accommodate the classes. The dimensions of the old building
were 92 feet in length by 42 feet wide, and three stories high. The addition
is 60 feet square and four stories high, with two large lecture-rooms, each contaniing comfortable seats for about six hundred persons. The rooms for the
Museum connected with this Department, have been enlarged and improved,
and indeed it is difficult to imagine any accommodation for professors or students that is not afforded in the new and enlarged building.
It is gratifying to observe the interest of the citizens of Ann Arbor in the
University. When you announced as the result of a careful examination of
the finances of the institution, shortly after the most of you entered upon your
term of office, that you could not enlarge the Medical Building without incurring
an unsafe debt, unless you could obtain the aid of at least ten thousand dollars,
the citizens of Ann Arbor, at a legal meeting, called to consider the subject,
authorized an appropriation of the sum neeeded, from the City Treasury, and
issued City Bonds for the amount, subject only to the sanction of the Legislalature of the State, which will undoubtedly be obtained. Thus the citizens of
Ann Arbor have willingly taxed themselves to pay $10,000 for the building,
notwithstanding the great demands that are made upon the property and the
people by the war waged against the enemies of the nation. It is therefore
with unwonted interest and pleasure that the people of this city look upon the
large and convenient building of the Medical College. A prosperous future
may be safely anticipated for this Department of the University.
In the Department of Law the number of Students during the past year has
been 221. The year preceding it was 134. This Department has been in operation only five years, and the average number of students has been 146.

<P><PB REF="00000058.tif" SEQ="00000058" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="887" N="58" DISPLAYN="58" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=umregproc;idno=acw7513.1864.001;debug=xml;c=umregproc;seq=58"/>
The new Law Building has now been in use one year, and is found to be admirably adapted to the purposes for which it was designed. It affords convenient
office-rooms for the professors, an excellent lecture-room, and all needed conveniences for the Law Library, Moot Courts, and the Society rooms of this
Department. The lecture-room, at some little inconvenience to this Department,
but for the general good, is used as a chapel by the Literary Department, for
daily Prayers, and for public worship on Sabbath afternoons. It is found to answer the purpose Well temporarily,though it would be regarded as a great boon,
and would indeed incalculably promote the interests of the University, if the
State would provide for it a suitable building to be used as a Chapel and for general public meetings. At present there is no room on the premises large enough
to accommodate all the Faculties and students at once.
The large room in the lower story of the Law Building is devoted to the
General Library, which belongs equally to all the Departments of the University, and is open every day, except Sundays, to the students. The walls have
been furnished with shelves, and the books are well arranged, but it is necessary immediately to provide alcoves for the accommodation of additional books.
The Public Library consists of more than 13,000 volumes, generally selected
with great care and judgment. It would be difficult to find a library of its size
so various and rich in valuable works. There is, however, a great preponderance of foreign works, and as the rates of exchange are now so high, I think it
would be well to confine the purchases principally to American books.
In this General Libiary we see one of the great advantages of a University over a mere College. The books are in one room, under the care of one
Librarian, and form a strong bond of union to the Departments. The Library
is much more liberal in its character than a Department collection would naturally be. The higher student of Medicine, for instance, about to graduate,
and wishing to consult the best authorities on the subject which he has chosen
for his thesis, need not confine himself to Medical writers, but leaving that part
of the Library devoted to them, may consult authors in history, metaphysics,
or any other field of thought, who can throw light on his theme. So the student in Law, or in any other exercise, may find in a General Library what he
would not be likely to find in a professional library.
The advantages of a University system are seen also in the Chemical Laboratory, which is believed to be one of the best in the world. By the admirable
system on which it is managed it is, with the exception of the salaries of those
engaged in it, about self-supporting, and continual additions are made to its
ample material and means of illustration. Under the care of Prof. S. H. Douglas, M.D., and his able assistants, it is open alike to students in the Literary and
Medical Departments, and its advantages are enjoyed by many who press their
investigations far beyond the ordinary elementary study of chemistry.

The Museum Building has been internally so improved, since the removal Of
the Library from it, as to afford increased room for the collections to illustrate
Natural Science. Several cases have been made to receive a large and excellent collection of fossils, gathered in Europe, by Carl Rominger, M.D., Assistant Curator of the Museum of Geology, Zoology and Botany. The University
has the use of this rich and rare collection now gratuitously, and I recommend
that it be purchased, if it can be for a reasonable price, and made a permanent
part of the Museum.
The following additions have been made to the Museum during the year:
Five skulls representing different human races, and six skulls of carniverous
-quadtipeds: presented by Rev. D. C. Jacokes, A.M.
A small collection of fossils from the lowest horizon of life in Wis'
consin.  Four of these proved to be of new species, and have been
described by Professor Winchell, with others from Michigan, in Silliman's
Journal, and credited to the Museum of the University.    Accompanying these fossils were about fifteen species of Unionidae from Wisconsin. These were presented by Joseph W. Wood, M.S.
A few specimens of ores of iron and zinc from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania were
presented by Dr. Riksecker of Ann Arbor.
Specimens of Travertin from T. 27 N., 9 E., and marl from four miles and a
half northwest of Alpina, Michigan, presented by C. F. Conrad, Esq.
Travertin and " Polishing Powder " from Section 12, Hamburg, Livingston
County, Michigan, presented by A.D. Peck, Esq.
Sections of Palmetto Wood from Morris Island, South Carolina, by Lieut..
Col. 0. L. Mann.
Several fossils from Trenton Quarry, Mengiuagon, Wayne County, Michigan,
by J. H. Farmer, M.D.
A collection of osteological preparations, consisting of about thirty skulls
and skeletons; also a box of memorials of the siege of Vicksburg collected
from the battlefields and other localities; also a portion of a pair of stocks employed in the punishment of slaves in Louisiana: presented by Prof. Winchell.
A fragment of Galena from the mines recently opened at New Galena, Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, by J. AM. Gross, Esq.

The Smithsonian Institute at Washington, through its Secretary, Prof. Joseph
Henry, has made many valuable presents to the University. During the past
year in addition to its regular publications it has presented to us 26 specimens of
Rocks and Building Stones, from various parts of the world, all properly label.
ed; 80 specimens of shells from Gape St. Lucas; 50 specimens, embracing 29
species of Mazatlan shells; a small collection of Panama shells.
All of the above have been thankfully received, and bear the names of their
donors.
Several additional cases for the Mineralogical Cabinet have been made, and
'this part of the Museum as usual is in excellent order.
The work of cataloguing and describing the specimens in Geology and Zoology is regularly-advancing, and within the last year a " Report Historical and
Statistical, of the Collections in Geology, Zoology, and Botany in the Museum of
the University, made to the Regents October 2d, 1863, by Alexander Winchell,
A. M., Professor of Geology, Zoology, and Botany," has been published; also
a" Report on the White Collection," together making a pamphlet of 26 pages.
Full descriptive Catalogues of all the specimens should be made and printed in
uniform style.
I trust that by greater efforts, hereafter, the collections, of all kinds, will be
-more rapidly increased.
The University has long enjoyed the use of an excellent collection of specimens belonging to Prof. C. L. Ford, M. D., forming an essential part of the
Museum in the Medical College, for which a small sum has been paid, much
less than the interest upon their cost. I suggest that proper efforts be made to secure a purchase of them as a permanent part of that Museum, which now needs
considerable enlargement.
The apparatus used for illustration in the various Departments, though not
technically belonging to the Museums, deserves mention. A large painting
of Athens, has been framed for the lecture room of the Professor of Greek, and
another of modern Rome for the lecture-room of the Professor of Latin. These
were painted by Mr.Wm.Wheeler of Hartford, Connecticut,and are not only valuable ornaments to the room, but of great practical use to the students in those

branches. Under the direction ofthe Professor of MatlLematic some excellent
apparatus to illustrate his department has been procured, and that belonging to
the department of Civil Engineering has been increased. Also a set of Charts
of the Survey of the Lakes of the Northwest, has been presented by Maj. Gen.
George G. Meade. In the department of History some additional Wall Maps
have been procured.
The Astronomical Observatory has, I think, accomplished as much as its liberal founders and its most sanguine friends could have expected.
The Meridian Circle has been employed in making observations for time and
accurate places of stars of comparison used in the differential observations with
the large equatorial. It was also used in a series of observations made in connection with the United States Lake Survey for determining the longitude of
Green Bay, Wisconsin, by means of the telegraph. The equatorial has been.employed in observations of planets and comets, and in examinations of the
physical structure of various objects.
On the 14th of September, 1863, while Prof. Watson was carefully examining the censtellation Pisces, within the limits of the Zodiac, he discovered a
planet of nearly the ninth magnitude in brilliancy, hitherto unknown to astronomers. Thisdiscovery was immediately announced through the Scientific journals and observations upon it were made at once in all the observatories in this
country and Europe. Prof. Watson continued carefully to observe its motions
till May 3, 1864, after which farther observations were impracticable, on account of its close proximity to the sun. Prof. Watson, by right of discovery
was called upon to name it, and selected the name Eurynome, which has been
generally adopted by astronomers.
On the the night of January 9th, he discovered also a new telescopic come
in the constellation Cygnus, which subsequently became visible to the naked
eye. Prof. Respighi, however, in Italy, as was announced a few days after in
this country., saw this comet on the morning of the 29th of December, 1864.
Prof. Watson, in accordanee with a plan proposed by Prof. Airy, of Greenwich, British Astronomer Royal, has undertaken regular and systematic observations of twelve planets, besides the ordinary routine work of the Observatory
At your last meeting provision was made for courses of lectures to be given
to students in. the Literary and Law Departments on Hygiene, and Professor
A. B. Palmer, M. D., was appointed to that work. I anticipate great good from
these lectures, and shall not be disappointed if hereafter it may be deemed advisable to provide also for some practical instruction and exercises in Physical
Education. But as the whole matter thus far is prospective, I can only allude
to it.

ceived, are added to the current assets of the University. There can be no
doubt that it would be a great advantage to the University to add this sum to
its funded capital, and I hope that the Regents will find it practicable, after
meeting all the increased annual expenses arising from the erection of the Law
Building and the enlargement of the Medical Building, to set apart at least a
portion of this sum as a Library Fund, to be added to from time to time, till
the whole sum of $22,000 is thus funded, the annual income of which should
be expended regularly to enlarge.and improve the Library. I can but believe
that should such a fund be created, there are many liberal citizens of Michigan
who would deem it a privilege to add to it. The time has arrived when the University may justly expect that the friends of sound science and liberal culture,
in the State and vicinity, will emulate the example of such men in other parts
of the country, and contribute to enlarge the funds of the University. Many
of the colleges in this country have received large accessions to their capital
within the last year, by liberal donations, and if the University of Michigan
would retain the honorable rank which it has so early gained, and fully carry
out the designs of its founders, it must not be left to depend upon the first im.
pulse given to it by the sale of the lands so wisely appropriated to its founda.

It is with sincere gratitude to God that I record the prosperity and progo
ress of the University during the past year. There are still many desirable
improvements to be made, some of which are urgently demanded. If these necessities as they disclose themselves are studied as carefully as similar demands
have been heretofore, the University will doubtless continue to accomplish all
that the State can justly expect,             E.. HAVEN.

Committee on the Scientific Course and the Chemical Laboratory.
The President presented the report of the Faculty on the
subject of establishing the study of Political Economy in the
University Course.
The report was accepted and referred to the Committee on
the Classical Course.
The President presented the following Annual Report of the
Librarian, which was accepted and referred to the Library
Committee:
LIBRARIAN'S REPORT.
The Librarian deems it proper, in presenting his first annual
report to the Board of Regents, to state somewhat fully the
present condition and immediate and prospective wants of the
Library, not, indeed, with the expectation that these will be
fully provided for, but that the Board may, from the whole, be
aided in selecting the most urgent wants for action.
NUMBER OF VOLUMES.
There are in the Library, according to a count which I, have
just made, 13,551 volumes, besides unbound periodicals, while
the entries in the catalogue number but 11,309. This difference of 2,242 volumes would be still increased by the erasure
from the catalogue of volumes missing and sold, which I believe
has never been done. If the catalogue were in other respects
what it should be, still these omissions would go far towards
rendering it worthless, as they are too numerous to admit of
correction without going over the whole.
PERIODICALS.
There are 75 periodicals, besides annuals, in the Library.
Of these 8 are properly newspapers. The Librarian once proposed, and the Committee formally concurred, that hereafter
these be no longer taken by mail, but purchased bound, at the
end of each year, half year, or quarter, as the case may require,
and as many as shall be deemed important for permanent use
thus obtained. This will give us cheaper and better copies,
and as these papers are not resorted to for the news, will
answer every purpose.
The periodical department of the Library is among the most
interesting and important even for permanent use. It is an

<P><PB REF="00000089.tif" SEQ="00000089" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="887" N="89" DISPLAYN="89" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=umregproc;idno=acw7513.1864.001;debug=xml;c=umregproc;seq=89"/>
epitome of all other literature, a guide to it, and to a great
extent a substitute for it. But according to its value, so are
the labor and expense of keeping it up. Of the volumes placed
aside soon after the commencement of the year, with reference
to binding, 67 were found incomplete, that is, lacked one number or more than one. This does not include instances in which
entire volumes were wanting, of which there were not a few.
This defect has originated partly from the Librarian's omission to send for numbers when they failed to reach the Library
from  the office of publication, until the edition had been
exhausted, and partly from Professors taking numbers without
presenting them for registration, and then neglecting to return
them.
With periodicals may be reckoned a large class of works
which are in a certain sense periodical, or are periodically, and
often and gratuitously received, such as scientific annuals, almanacs, learned society reports, legislative and executive documents. Some of these works could easily,be obtained gratis;
others ought to be regularly purchased; but, in truth, we have
very few series of this kind perfect. In legislative reports there
is no such continuity, or dependence as to make it important to
have all. In other cases it is important to have complete sets.
There is another class of works published as serials which
should never be taken by the Library as such. Grimm's Worterbuch, for instance, the successive numbers of which will be
of no value until the whole is complete, except to some one who
enjoys reading a dictionary through in course. The Librarian
has now before him much vexatious labor, to complete sets of
these serial publications. The set, when perfect, would cost
less money, and as to labor and vexation, there is more connected with each number of a series than there would be in
procuring the whole set at once.
BINDING.
The preservation of the Library requires that all periodicals
be bound as soon as possible after the completion of the volumes; 'so of all serial and other works purchased unbound.
We have between 500 and 600 volumes, the good preservation
and free use of which require that they be bound. On the
other hand, I ooks should not be bound simply because we have
them and can increase our number of volumes by it, if they are
not worth it. Twenty-nine volumes of booksellers' catalogues
were bound last year, which have no value. Again, there are
many pamphlets worth preservation, but not worth binding.
A few dollars, under the head of incidentals, would provide
pasteboard cases in which such might be arranged, labeled, and

made as convenient as bound volumes for use. The appropria.
tion for binding should certainly be larger this year than usual.
GENERAL REMARKS UPON THE ABOVE.
I have thus far referred to defects in work already done, and
have had in mind the perfection and conservation of what we
have, rather than enlargement. It is, indeed important to enlarge; but it is in my opinion even more important to take immediate measures to perfect and utilize what we have, in order
to establish a basis upon which enlargement will be improvement. Let me here forestall an inference, viz.: that I would
charge my predecessors with neglect of duty, by saying that it
will probably appear in the course of this report that all this
variety and extent of labor, at least as it now is, cannot be performed without more help than has been allowed. I must confess, too, that, aside from my unwillingness to have work half
done, I have a somewhat personal motive for referring plainly
to these deficiencies. The Board of Regents, in the faithful discharge of their duty will doubtless, at no distant day, institute a
rigid inquiry into the condition and wants of the Library. If
such inquiry should be thorough, it must reveal these defects,
and though it should trace their origin back to others, it must
make the present Librarian responsible for quietly allowing
their continuance, if he shall do so. All experience shows that
if reforms are not introduced soon after the inauguration of a
new regime, their subsequent introduction becomes every day
more difficult, and must finally be affected by the appointment
of a new head, who, by having new advantages given him, will
easily effect that for which he is no better qualified than was
his predecessor. If a man is, for any reason whatever, unable
to enter upon a work ot reform, his eyes and mind, bound to
tolerate disorder, becomes at length indifferent to it, and I
therefore earnestly desire to be furnished with the facilities for
improving the condition of the Library, before this state of indifference shall come upon me.
I have made above some reference to the class of labor which
has always been done in the Library, naming some of the imperfections bf its performance. I now desire to refer to a new
class of work specially needed.
CATALOGUE.
There should be a carefully prepared card-catalogue. I have
been familiar with the working of such in a library having over
900,000 volumes, and never found more than two or three minutes necessary in order to ascertain whether a given book belonged to the library. If our catalogue here contained every

book in the Library-which it does not by nearly 3000-it
would cost us ten or fifteen minutes to be satisfied' one way or
the other. I am happy to cite the complete success of the experiment at Harvard in favor ot this system.
INDEX OF SUBJECTS.
Students every day, and not unfiequently professors, enter
the Library knowing very well what subject they would investigate, but utterly ignorant as to where it is well treated. The
Librarian is resorted to for help a great many times every day
in this particular; but if he were himself a perfect index, he
could not give separately to each one who might ask the needed
instruction. Much might be done towards teaching students
the use of a library by the course contemplated by the Board,
in requesting the Librarian at its last session to give a few lectures; but this would do nothing towards supplying the place
of an index, though it might tell how to use one. The library
may have abundance of works on the subjects demanding an
investigation, and still a great portion of the students never get
on their track. The recent report of Harvard refers enthusiastically to the working of such an index in the library of that
institution.
THE HELP NEEDED IN THE LIBRARY.
If everything in the Library were perfect-that is, if every
set of books and periodicals in it were full, a perfect catalogue
and index of subjects prepared coplete to the present moment,
all books and periodicals bound and arranged for preservation
and use-it would still be impossible to carry out well the
affairs of the Library and perpetuate this perfection without
much additional help; how much more when so large an amount
of labor left either unfinished or untouched, has been bequeathed
to the Librarian by his predecessors?
If it had been expected or even desired that the Board
should immediately act upon the statements and suggestions of
this paper, it would have been deemed necessary to present the
subjects of the additional labor needed more in detail. This is,
however, not desired. The subject should be thoroughly discussed in the University Senate, certainly thoroughly investi.
gated by a committee of the Board. Such inquiry I wish
might be early instituted for which a special meeting of the
committee at another time than that of the session of the
Board ought perhaps to be held.
The aid of undergraduates, as hitherto, can scarcely be used
for any other purpose than to wait on Students and Professors,
and but a portion of that. They have but little time, and that

littl is broken into fiagments. The work is itself of great advantage to those who do it, and there would be enough competitiic for it at a very low price, About $200 to be divided
among three young men for the entire term time, and $35 for
the long vacation is about what is needed.
While upon this subject, I take the liberty to refer briefly to
the change which has taken place within a comparatively few
years in regard to the use of libraries in connection with a college or university course in this country. In most of our colleges the library used to be in some room of a dormitory buildfg, some professor being nominally librarian, but doing no work
and recei:.2ng no pay. No attempt was made to keep up with
the literature of the time.  Small additions were sometimes
made, and the whole was preserved by being locked up. Some
student who bore the title of assistant librarian, opened the
library once in two, three, or four weeks. Harvard, which has
taken the lead in regard to a library, even as late as 1797,
allowed only the junior and senior classes access to the library,,and that but once in three weeks. Yale opens its library even
towlonly to Juniors and Seniors of the College course, and it is
open only during the forenoon or until one o'clock P. M.; but
the Libra'ian says that public opinion will soon demand an increase of acessible hours. At Harvard the Library is open five
days in the week in term,time, but only forenoon and afternoon, and not, as here, in the evening; and yet, at this vener-.able school, when this throwing open of the Library fairly
commenced, in connection with an effort to keep it supplied
with reading fully up to the times, a division of labor was inaugurated by which eight persons are fully employed in the affairs
of the Library, and no undergraduate labor is used. The most
of these persons are employed to do service not calling for high
salaries, and yet, so nearly as I can tell by the statements before me, the pay amounts to more than $6,000 per annum.
When it is remembered that the labor of administering a
Library, does not depend upon the number of volumes in it, but
upon their use, the surface over which they are spread, and the
additions annually made, and when it is fiurther remembered
that we are in advance of all others in regard to the number of
hours during which we are open, and the number of students
whom we accommodate, and yet behind all our more prominent
institutions in regard to expenditure upon the care of the
Library, it will be naturally suspected that this department
needs attention. Department after department has been added,
Professors and assistant instructors, as well as students, have
been constantly multiplied, a new department-that of mining
-is in immediate expectation, and still another is regarded as
not distant; and it is to be hoped that in the midst of all this

progressive enlargerment the wants of the Library will not t1

INCREASE OF SHELVES FOR BOOKS.
The subject of the extension of our room for books has beers
before the Library Committee, and there is a general concurrence in the plan for effecting this. I shall only add in regard
to this point that until this shall be done, any considerable irnprovement in the arrangement of the books will be impossible,
As each book cannot be put where it belongs, many must be
found where they do not belong.
PERCHIASES.
I began in good time, as I supposed,c a comparison of the
bills in the Steward's hands with the records in the Library;
but after long and tedious labor, continued even to' late hours
of night, it became evident to me that I couald not finish the'
statement of books, periodicals, and binding, with the cost of
each in the time remaining to me, without making it a mere
transcript of'the bills. In regard to bills belonging to the
period during which I have been in the Library, the labor was
easy and could have been accomplished in a few hours; but of
the purchases made previously to my entrance upon duty, a
large number had never been entered upon the catalogue; ot
those not entered, some were found upon the shelves and some
were not. Some I had no recollection of ever having seen, and
indeed, it is quite certain that some bought with the Library
appropriations have never been in the Library.
In order that my report upon these points may not be a mere
unsupported copy of bills in the Steward's office, I beg to present the statement in a supplementary report at a late period,
thus taking time to know in each instance, not only that a work
has been paid for, but also whether it has been actually received
and entered upon the catalogue, and remains still upon our
shelves. I shall take occasion to add also a list of sets and
series, incomplete or broken, and thus make the report an illustration of what has been stated above in regard to these deficiencies; and even if this work should require the use of a large
portion of the vacation, I shall endeavor faithfully and fully to
perform it.

WEDNESDAY MORNING, 
June 28, 1865.

Present-The President, Regents Walker, Willard, Gilbert
Knight, Joslin, Sweezey and Stockwell.
The minutes of the preceding day were read and approved.
The President presented a communication fiom the graduating classes expressing their gratification and profit from the
course of lectures on Physiology and Hygiene, delivered by
Professor A. B. Palmer during the past year.
Regent Gilbert, from the Finance Committee, to whom was
referred the petition from the First National Bank of Ann
Arbor and others, presented the following report, which was
adopted:
The Finance Committee, to whom was referred a communication from the officers of the First National Bank of Ann
Arbor, and others, asking that that institution be constituted
Treasurer of the University, report: That the rules of the University require that the person acting as its Treasurer shall give
bonds for the faithful discharge of his duty, and the safe
keeping of its funds, and that while they have entire confidence
in the institution soliciting the appointment, and as individuals
would not desire security for funds deposited with it, yet we
are of opinion that it is not competent for the Bank under its
articles of association and the law under which it is organized,
to give the required security for the safe keeping of the moneys
of the University. The difficulty might be obviated by the appointment of some friend of the Bank who would give it the
benefit of the deposit; but your Committee know of no reason
why the present incumbent should be removed, or any change
made, except that it is evidently unnecessary to longer continue
the payment of a salary to the Treasurer.
Your Committee therefore offer the following resolution for
the consideration of the Board.
-Resolved, That on and after the first day of July, A. D. 1865,
the salary heretofore paid to the Treasurer of the University
shall cease.
Regent Gilbert presented a communication from D. McIntyre,

The minutes of the morning session were read and approved.
The following communication was received from Professors
Watson and Williams in response to the foregoing resolution,
which was read and ordered to be entered upon the minutes:
To the Hon. the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
The undersigned to whom was referred, by a resolution of
your honorable body, the question of the propriety of removing
the Observatoryfrom its present position, begleave to report that
they have given the subject careful consideration, and that they
unhesitatingly recommended that the Observatory shall be
rebuilt on the University Campus, for reasons among which are
the following:
1. The foundations which could be obtained on the University Campus are much better adapted to the proper stability of
the Instruments than those of the present site, and the difficulty
of disturbance by the motion of railroad trains would be wholly
obviated.
2. That the present building is in many essentials improperly
constructed and not adapted to the proper employment of thy
instrumental facilities with which it is provided; all of which
could be remedied in its reconstruction.
3. That the present building has only ordinary protection
from fire, and that a new structure could be arranged so as to
make the parts containing the instruments fire proof, or nearly
so, which they consider of great importance.
4. That some provision'should be made here for making.and
recording magnetical and meteorological observations, and
that these objects could be promoted in the case of the proposed removal, but are almost wholly impracticable in the case
of the present location of the Observatory.
5. That an Observatory Building on the University Campus
would afford stability for the instruments and a horizon sufficiently unobstructed and not in danger of being obstructed; and
further, that they believe its facilities for useful and enduring
work, both in actual contributions to science and in imparting
instruction to the youth who assemble here, would be very
much increased.
6. That no difficulty is to be apprehended from dust and
smoke in the case of an Observatory located on the proposed
site for the new structure.
7. That no additional annoyance from interruption by visitors is to be feared,, and that they think there will be no diffi

SEPTEMBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
Tuesday, Sept. 26; 1865.
The Board of Regents assembled at 11 o'clock, A. M.
Present-President Haven, Regents, Willard, Gilbert,
Knight, Johnson, Sweezey and Stockwell.
The Meeting was opened with reading the Scriptures and
prayer by the President.
The minutes of the meeting held Aug. 23d, 1865, were read
and approved.
The President read his Annual Report, which was accepted
and placed on file.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of
AMichigan.
GENTLEMEN:
The number of students attending the University of Michigan during the year just closed has been unprecedentedly
large, notwithstanding the standard of scholarshap for admission in the Literary Department has been carefully maintained.
The number in the Department of Science, Literature and the
Arts was 279, of whom 117 were engaged in the regular Classical Course of Study, 68 in the regular Scientific Course of
Study, 8 in the Course of Study prescribed for Civil Engineers, 21 in Higher Chemistry alone, and 65 in Selected
Studies.
It will be seen from the above classification-that the theory of
affording to young men an opportunity to select the kind and
degree of study suited to their tastes and demands, is carefully
obeyed. This plan accords with the views of the most ens
lightened and able minds of the present age, and with the
purposes which a State University ought to subserve, It should

afford to the youth who have enjoyed the privileges of the Uiiion Schools of the State opportunity to pursue farther, and to
any desirable extent, any branches of literary or scientific investigation which they may choose. While it preserves the particular course of study that has been honored by the experience of many generations, and has received the approval of
many of the best scholars of all countries, it should respond to
the demands of others equally energetic and able, who ask for
a variety of studies better adapted, as they believe, to many
minds, and to secure the practical results which they desire.
The University of Michigan has not chosen to engraft upon
itself Scientific Schools, with an imperfect and abnormal connection, but to develop together, harmoniously, and under one
government, and largely under tho same professors, several
various departments of investigation and culture. The experiment thus far is entirely successful.
During the past year another step in this direction has been
taken in providing for a Department of Mining Engineering. All the instruction needed by a student of this science
was already afforded, except what specially pertains to mining
operations. This, by the increased provisions made to assist
the Professor of Chemistry, and by giving some additional
labor to the Professors of Geology and Civil Engineering, can
easily be accomplished.
And this naturally suggests the expression of a general fact
that ought to be understood by all interested in higher education in this State. Professional or Industrial Schools of any
character can be much more conveniently and economically
supported in connection with the University, than independently or alone. For the expenditure of say $3,000 a year we
can maintain a better School of Mines than could be established
and supported by itself in any place in this State for $10,000 a
year. For $5,000 a year we could sustain a better Agricultural
Schoolthan can be sustained independently for $15,000 or 20,000
a year. We already have the greater part of the means necessary. The instruction in all the literary studies, the General
Library, the Laboratory-unsurpassed anywhere-the Museums, we already have; and nothing is wanting but the simple
addition of the special study peculiar to the department desired.
With a little addition to our annual income any special department can be provided for.
As it regards the whimsical objection that students preparing
to be farmers, mining engineers, civil engineers, &amp;c., will not
feel at home with those studying to fit themselves to be physicians, lawyers, ministers, teachers, authors, &amp;c.-it is founded
only on ignorance of the facts. It is never heard from any one
who has been connected with the University in any capacity,
or who has taken any pains to inform himself of the truth.

Our students are the sons of men engaged in all varieties of
industry, and are preparing for as great a variety of employments as those pursued by their fathers, and are all on terms of
equality in the University.
The Department of Science, Literature and the Arts has not
increased in numbers in proportion to the other two Departments. Indeed for several years previous to 1864 it had been
gradually diminishing, and though it has considerably increased for the past two years, it is not now much larger than
it was in 1859, and for several years preceding. Several reasons can be given for this fact. The standard of scholarship
in this Department is high,-none being admitted who are
not prepared. There are many other colleges in this part of
the country the most of which require much less of candidates
for admission, while the professional schools are few. But
perhaps the greatest difficulty that this Department has to contend with, is the extravagant zeal of our young men to study
a profession without an adequate preliminary education. It is
painful to think of the superficiality and feebleness in scholarship which threaten our Western society, from the hot haste of
our young men to assume the most difficult tasks of manhood,
without a proper training. The few instances of highly successful men who have not been educated largely in schools, mislead this class of minds, who are not sufficiently well informed
to see that on such subjects every rule has its apparent exceptions. The great want of the day is a thorough, accurate
scholarship. There is a plenty of general information, of flippant familiarity with many subjects-but there is not enough
of broad and thorough culture.
We would draw no unfavorable comparison in this respect
between our own and other lands-many of which are often
overestimated on the principle that distance lends enchantment
to the view-least of all do we lend our influence to the silly
sentiment that it has lately become fashionable to retail, that
America has no universities-but still we cannot deny that in
such a gloriously free land as ours, where without restrictions
genius or talent, educated or uneducated, has opportunity to
exert itself, it is not'wonderful that the temptations should be
great to avoid hard labor, and to substitute the showy for the
weighty, the striking for the profound.
It is therefore becoming that all who have influence over the
young, and especially that teachers should sustain and promote
a healthy public opinion on this subject. It is a wrong done
to a young man to hurry him into a profession without adequate scholarship-a wrong which we have heard many persons bitterly deplore-while we have never met an instance of
a person who regretted having spent a long time in previous
study.

When teachers and youth come properly to understand the
facts, we shall see all wh6 propose to be physicians, lawyers
or ministers, or teachers, or civil or mining engineers graduating at college, or completing a course of study equivalent to
what is required in the University for graduation. As public
opinion advances towards this standard, the Department of
Science, Literature and the Arts will be more largely attended;
and that the numbers, especially of those who are completing a
regular course of study, are now slowly but regularly increasing, indicates a decided improvement in this direction.
In this Department there have been no changes in the persons of the Faculty, but Mr. Adam K. Spence and Mr. Charles
K. Adams, formerly Instructors, have been made Assistant
Professors in their departments respectively, with a slight increase of salary. The same change has been made in the position of Mr. A. S. Curtis, to take effect next year.
Also Prof. A. B. Palmer, who has been connected with the
Medical Department since 1852, entered upon his labors at the
beginning of the past year as Professor of Hygiene in the Literary Department. All the students in the four college classes
in both courses of study have heard from him a series of lectures on the general subject of Hygiene. The lectures have
been listened to with much interest, and must exert a salutary
effect upon those who hear them.
The election of Prof. T. M. Cooley as one of the Associate
Judges of the Supreme Court of the State imposes such duties
upon him as will render it inconvenient to deliver a course of
lectures on Constitutional History and Law, as heretofore, to
the Senior class in the Literary Department, but in place of
them, instruction in Political Economy and Logic will be given
by the President.
The Chemical Laboratory has been employed to the extent
of its capacity for accommodating students during the entire
year. The excellence of the facilities and instruction here
afforded, and the small expense to the students when compared
with other laboratories of the kind, render this one of the most
popular branches of the University. Too high terms can
scarcely be employed in its commendation.
The great labor connected with it, and the instruction now
furnished to those who wish to qualify themselves for Mining
Engineering, have rendered it necessary to employ additional
instruction, and therefore A. B. Prescott has been appointed
Assistant Professor of Chemistry, and Lecturer on Organic
Chemistry and Metallurgy.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery has been very
prosperous. The new building was not erected too soon, as
without it, the large number of students of the past year could
not possibly have been accommodated.
The whole, number of students during the year in this De

partment was 414, of whom 71 completed the required course
of study, and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine.
No change has taken place in the Faculty during the year.
The great and unprecedented success of this Department is a
fact of which the state may justly be proud.
Two changes in this Department have been proposed, which
I trust will receive careful consideration. The one is to establish
two professorships to teach thoroughly the principles and art of
Dentistry, including Dental Hygiene and Mechanical D ntistry and Metallurgy. There can be no doubt that these professorships would supply a great demand. The entire public
is interested in the thorough scientific attainments of those who
profess to be prepared to perform dental operations, and the
Department of Medicine and Surgery cannot claim to be complete without affording the best facilities to students in dentistry. This is one of many directions in which the advantages
of the University could be increased if its resources were sufficient:
It has also been proposed by Regent Stockwell, Chairman of
the Committee on the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
that candidates for admission to this Department, and also to
that of Law, should be examined on the Literary studies, already
in form required of them by the rules of the University, unless
they have certificates or diplomas of graduation in college.
This is no new subject. The necessity of good general
scholarship in physicians and lawyers will not be denied by
any considerate person. This has been insisted upon to a colnmendable extent in the examination of candidates for graduation in both of these Departments, but inasmuch as candidates
for admission have not heretofore been examined, it is to be
feared that in some instances persons of inadequate scholarship
may have attended one or more courses of lectures, and though
they have not graduated, the mere fact of having attended the
lectures gives them some prestige and influence as practitioners in the professions, to which their general scholarship would
not entitle them. If so, this is a wrong done to the University,
to the professions and to the public. The University can afford
to insist upon good scholarship. It is a positive duty to do so.
Temptations to obtain a large number of students should not
interfere with so clear an obligation to science and right. I
trust that the Committees to whom this subject may be referred will investigate the subject thoroughly and fearlessly,
and arrive at the best results.
The Department of Law has had during the year 260 students, of whom 80 completed the prescribed course of study and
received the degree of Bachelor of Laws.
This Department has been so prosperous and so largely attended that the services of an additional Professsr have been
engaged for the next year.

The opening of this department in 1859 was regarded as an
experiment, and it was thought that the few students who might
attend it would easily be accommodated in the rooms belonging to the Literary Department. It was soon found necessary
to erect a building specially for the Law Department. The
number of students has steadily increased, until it has become
the largest Law School in the country. The thoroughness. of
the instruction imparted, and the facilities afforded, not only for
becoming acquainted with the broad science of Law, but with
the practices of Courts, will undoubtedly render this Department increasingly popular.
It is almost impossible so to manage a University as not to
feel constantly the unpleasant pressure of poverty. The things
demanded and possible are so much greater than the resources
of any institution will command, that for a long time, if not
always, the University will feel inconveniently harrassed by the
want of fundsi
We live in a time of large enterprises. Especially is a great
degree of public attention now directed to University education in this country. It seems to be universally concluded and
felt that this is an imperative demand of high civilization, and
of our free country. The property contributed by benevolent
individuals in this country to colleges and universities, during
the last two years, amounts actually to several millions of dollars. It is a painful fact that the University of Michigan has
not been the&amp;recipient of any of these benefactions. Eastward,
Southward, and even Westward of us large and liberal donations have been made, but none to this institution, confessedly
in the front rank in efficiency as well as in numbers. Why this
defect? Is there no enterprise of this kind in Michigan? Is
there a jealousy of an institution owned and managed by the
State?  Are Americans prepared to distrust their own institutions and themselves? Cannot the people be trusted? Where
can money be so judiciously employed as where foundations
are already well laid, and the means at command are the most
carefully and successfully employed?
We desire that the University, which has been so wisely
developed with the means afforded by the first and only grant
of property ever made to it, should continue to grow with the
growth of the country.
Our present necessities are pressing and multiplying. Our
professors have been toiling with salaries, especially for the
past four years, painfully inadequate to their merits and necessities. New professorships and new departments are needed.
We most earnestly invite the attention of individuals and of
the state to the opportunities here afforded to reach the largest
possible good results by the use of additional means.
Some of the things most needed at present are the following:

1. Improvements in the Museum.
The wants of that part of the Museum devoted to the illustration of Geology, Zoology and Botany have been faithfilly
set forth in a communication to the Board of Regents by Prof.
Winchell, the main facts and recommendations of which I will
here recapitulate and endorse.
No science at present is receiving more attention for the service it has done and is capable of doing, to the economical interests of mankind, than these. They have entered upon a
system of development, which in some places has already attained a magnitude, which, twenty years since, would scarcely
have been considered possible. Not to speak of the vast museums of London, Paris, Berlin, and other European capitals,
there have been founded in our country several museums of
Natural History, which promise soon to rank with the best in
Europe.  The museums of the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington, the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia, the Society of Natural History at Boston, and ot the
Institution of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, enjoy the
first rank among American collections in Natural History.
The Museum of the University of Michigan has, until recently, enjoyed a rank next to those which have just been mentioned. Indeed, no college has a larger Museum. To maintain
this distinction it is necessary that renewed efforts should be
made for the obtaining of material. At present and for the
past few years not a dollar is at the disposal of the Museum for
the purchase of desirable specimens when offered, as they often
are, at advantageous rates, nor to defray the expenses of travel,
when a competent collector has been willing to give his labor
to the business. Therefore the main sources of growth have
been the Trowbridge deposit, the purchase of the White Collection for $500 (well worth $1,500,) the gifts of the Smithsonian
Institution, and the casual donations of individuals, especially
of the Professor in charge. The consequence is total defects
in many of the most important branches of investigation.
In the Museums of several of the older colleges in this country, and in the departments, of investigation connected with
them, several men are -employed as professors and assistants, in
doing the work here entrusted to one. The contrast between
what is done in Yale College, Harvard College, the University
of Rochester and other institutions, and what is done here at
present, is too painful to be set forth in detail.
It has therefore been recommended by Prof. Winchell, and in
that I heartily join, that a suitable person be employed as
Curator of the Museum of Geology, Zoology and Botany,
charged with the duty of laboring for the increase and preservation of the collections. Such a person, it is believed, can
now be obtained for a small annual salary. We believe that
the results will be such as to greatly enhance the efficiency of

this vital part of the material of the University. I append to
this Report a communication to me, and drawn up at my request, from Prof. Winchell, describing the additions to the
department of the Museum under his charge, and also presenting some other statements and recommendations worthy of
consideration.
The department of the Museum embracing specimens in
mineralogy has been, as heretofore, under the charge of Prof.
Douglass. Increased space having been given to that department, the collections have been displayed in a much more convenient and attractive manner, and many new specimens have
been placed on the shelves.
The other parts of the Museum do not present such pressing
necessities at present, though much will be needed hereafter
to enable them to keep pace with the growth of science and
the increasing demands of the University.
2. Another want of the University is a Chapel, or building
with an audience room large enough to accommodate together
all the officers and students, and the assemblages that would
gather on public occasions.
At present we have no such room, nor can we command one
even in the city.
The Alumni and other parties have proposed to collect funds
for the erection of such a building, and it has been hoped that
one of a Memorial or Monumental character might be presented to the UTniversity, in honor of the many brave men who
devoted their lives to the preservation of the Union in the war
just now so successfully and happily closed. Nearly a thousand soldiers went from the halls of this University to the war.
Many others went from its immediate vicinity. While I rejoice that monuments will be erected to their memory in Detroit and elsewhere in the State, 1 can but suggest that a building here on the University grounds, visited as it would be by
thousands of people fron all parts of our State and the country,
and indeed fioni other nations, ornamented as it would be in
the course of time with proper commemorative tablets, pictures
and statuary, and preserving in safety many memorials and
relics of the war, would at once incite patriotism in the hearts
of the young in all time to come, and be a lasting, and glorious,
and fitting, and ever-improving testimonial to the brave men
who. fought for union and liberty.  An enterprise which so
strongly appeals to all the better principles of our nature, it is
hoped, will not fail of execution, though it may not be speedily
accomplished.
While I mention these external improvements which are
deemed so desirable, it would be improper to lose sight of the
fact that the chief elements of power in a University are internal. They belong to the mental and moral nature. A University must not be measured by its grounds and buildings.



</P>
<P><PB REF="00000115.tif" SEQ="00000115" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="848" N="115" DISPLAYN="115" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=umregproc;idno=acw7513.1864.001;debug=xml;c=umregproc;seq=115"/>

They may be spacious and architecturally splendid, and yet the
University only a picture, or even radically wrong. On the
other han'd if the professors are able, accomplished and industrious men, and students are attracted to it and properly educated and disciplined, whatever its external appearance, it is a
great and beneficent power among men. Too many, especially in this country, have sought the appearance rather than the
fact.
It should awaken our gratitude that such is the reputation of
the University that it is the most largely attended in the country. Students fiom all the loyal States are found in its classes.
Thus the first University founded by a donation of the
United States has been so carefully and skillfully managed,
under the care of the State of Michigan, as to command not
only the respect of her own citizens, but of the country at large.
While the people of the State look upon it with just gratification, it is hoped that a generous and wise policy in its management will always be maintained, and that the favor of the people and the blessings of a Divine Providence will ever be its
protection and support.

quested to prepare the annual report of the Board of Regents,
to the Supt. of Public Instruction, to be submitted to the Regents, severally, for their signatures.
The President presented the following communication:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of
M: chigan:
We, the undersigned, a Committee appointed by the Society
of Alumni of the University of Michigan, at its last annual meeting, to mature plans and inaugurate means to erect a Memorial
Building to the memory of the graduates of the.University,
and all others connected with it who have fallen in the recent
civil war, would respectfully petition your Honorable Body to
grant to the Society of the Alumni a permit to occupy in perpetuity so much of the University grounds as may be necessary
for such a building, and in consideration of such permit the
Society will grant in perpetuity the use of the same to the
University of Michigan for all its anniversary, religious, and
such other exercises as the Board of Managers of the Society
of Alumni may from time to time permit.
E. P. EVANS,
Ann Arbor, Sept. 26th, 1865.         T. R. CHASE.
Regent Knight presented the following:
Resolved, That the Executive Committee be authorized to
perfect any necessary arrangements with the Association of
Alumni for the erection of a 'Memorial Building, with instructions to arrange for such building, when completed, belonging to the University, with such binding stipulations,
however, as may be necessary to insure the perpetual appropriation of the same for its sacred and important uses; such
Conmmittee to report their proposals to the Board for final action.
On motion of Regent Johnson, the proposition now before
the Board was laid on the table.
Regent Stockwell, from the Committee on the Medical Department, to whom was referred the petition of the State Dental Association and others, in relation to the establishing of a
chair of Dentistry in the University, submitted the following
report, which was adopted.
Your Committee would respectfully report that, having carefully considered the prayer of the petitioners, with a full appreciation of the importance of the subject presented, they are of
the opinion that the proper time for the introduction of a Department of Dentistry has not arrived.
Theory taught without practice, however well taught, would
seem not to answer the desire of the petitioners, or the necessi

ties of the students, and moreover would be of little credit to
the University.
The income of the University will not, at this time, warrant
the introduction of the expensive machinery of a Practical
School of Dentistry, because the material necessary for practical teaching would require a large expenditure of the funds of
the University in the procuring of means and the payment of
Teachers, as clinical teaching seems to your Committee an
absolute necessity.
The President presented the following preamble and resolutions:
WHEREAS, The Observatory needs repairs and an addition
to the buildings to render it efficient; and whereas, the people
of Ann Arbor have generously offered the sum of ten thousand
dollars to rebuild it in a thorough manner on the University
Campus; and whereas, it can be perfected on the present site
for about five thousand dollars, which it is believed would be
equally satisfactory to the University and to the people of Ann
Arbor; therefore,
Resolved, That if the city of Ann Arbor will furnish to the
University three thousand dollars, the -R-egents will accept it
with thanks, instead of the ten thousand which they have so
generously offered, and will expend the same for the improvement of the Observatory on its present site.
Adopted by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Willard, Gilbert, Knight, Johnson, Sweezey
and Stockwell.
It was moved that the Committee appointed to superintend
the erection of the new Observatory be a Committee to superintend the expenditure of the above amount.
Adopted.

the expiration of the fiscal year, the expenses for the same
time as per the estimates, will be $6,611 82 in excess of the

The Secretary presented the following communication from
-Ion. Judge Fletcher, of Boston, Massachusetts, which was
ordered to be printed in the Minutes:
BOSTON, July 16, 1866.
John HI. Burleson, Esq. 
DEAR SIn-Your letter of the 6th instant and an engrossed
copy of the action taken by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, with reference to the donation of my private Law Library to the Law Library of the University, have
both been received. The kind and courteous manner in which
the donation of my Law Libra- 'y has been accepted, is certainly
highly gratifying to me. It affords me pleasure to know that
the books, which I collected in the course of a long professional life, will not be scattered, but will remain together foi
the use of students in the Law Departlment of' the great University of the Northwest.
The Board of Regents, in giving my name to a Professorship of Law, have conferred an honor on me which I desire
most gratefully to acknowledge.
The University of Michigan must surely be regarded with
admiration by all who are acquainted with its history, and its
present condition, and have a just apprehension of its greatness and usefulness in the future.
Please accept my thanks for your communication,
I am, Dear Sir, with great respect,
Your Obedient Servant,
RICHARD FLETCHER.
The President read his annual report to the Board, which
was accepted and ordered on file.
The President also read a statement made to him by Professor Winchell of the additions made to the Museum during the.last year, which was referred to the Committee on the Museum.
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT.
The University has been so uniformly prosperous and suc-,cessful during the past year, that there is but little of incident
in its history needing mention in my Annual Report. No
change was made in the Faculty, none in the courses of study,

all Departments were larger than in the preceding year. The
year was singularly free from disturbances or difficulties of any
kind.
The number of students was, as follows:

The number of Graduates during the year in the various departments was as follows:
Department of Science, Literature, and the Arts, Civil Engineer, 7; Bachelor of Science, 6; Bachelor of Arts, 30; Master
of Arts, 19; Master of Science, 5. In the Department, 67.
Department of Medicine and Surgery, Doctor of Medicine,
74. Department of Law, Bachelor of Laws, 108. Also the
Honorary Degree of LL. D. was conferred on one person and
the Honorary Degree of M. A. on one. Total number of degrees conferred 251.
But very little addition has been made during the year to
the Endowment Fund, or to the property of the University.
So extensive are the grounds and so numerous are the buildings, that all of the money collected from the students for incidental expenses will not suffice to make the necessary repairs
and improvements.
An effort has been made to improve the Astronomical Observatory, which, if fully successful, will be of great value to that
essential part of the University. It was at first proposed to
remove the Observatory from its present site to the University
Square, and dispose of the present lot and building, and for
this purpose the city of Ann Arbor offered to pay $10,000, proviled that an equal sum was raised elsewhere. But, on mature

reflection, it was deemed not wise to give up five acres of
ground, the present beautifil and eligible Observatory lot.
The city is rapidly growing in that vicinity; it will soon be
surrounded with dwelling houses, and the streets to it will be
improved. The city, therefore, has promised to present to the
University $3,000, of which $2,500 is to be expended for the
improvement of the building, under the direction of the Regents, and $500 for the improvement of the streets about the
Observatory lot under the direction of' the City Governmlent;
all of which is on condition that:an equal sum of $3,000 be
devoted to the improvement of' the Observatory by the Regents.
These conditions have been complied witl. Prof. Watson has
secured subscriptions, mostly in Detroit, amouniting' to 63,000,
and the city of Ann Arbor lhas issued bonds for the payment of
$3,000 at 7 per cent. interest, $2,500 of which are in the hands
of the Regents. These bonds need to be authorised by the
State Legislature.
It is exceedingly desirable thast this improvement of the
Observatory should be now carried to a proper completion. It
has been demonstrated that the work which can be done here
is equal to that performed in any other Observatory in the
world. We should not be satisfied with merely re-roofing the
small building so as to protect ttle instruments, and adding to
it a few rooms for the accolmmodation of the Director, but
should also seek an endowment of the Observatory by a fiund
of at least $25,000, the interest of which would pay the salaries of those employed in it, anld afford some means for publishing valuable papers. If this matter is suitably presented
before the friends of science in our State, particularly il Detroit, to whom we are indebted for the Observatory, we have
reason to believe that this fund can be raised.
To see the necessity of this endowment it may be well to
notice the resources of' other Observatories with which ours is
to co-operate and compete. Many of them are richly furnished
with means and men, and yet, we may ask, which of them has
contributed more to science, during the past few years, than the
"'Detroit Observatory" of the University of' Michigan at Ann
Arbor?

The celebrated Astronomical Observatory at Pulkowa, Russia, under the Director, Prof. Struve, has a corps of seven
observers and computers, a library of 1,525 volumes and an
annual appropriation of $25,000. The Observatory at Washington has a Superintendent and from eight to twelve observers; about $25,000 per annum is expended for it, besides the
printing which is done at the Government printing office. The
Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, has a Director and
two assistants, and expends about $7,000 annually.
Let the liberal friends of science in Detroit complete the work
which they have so happily begun; let the building be enlarged, and let the Observatory have an independent endowment of about $30,000, the interest of which will support the
Director and pay for the printing of valuable observations and
calculations and other papers, and the whole will be a perpetual and noble monument of the far-seeing liberality of its
founders.
In my last Report I called attention to the pressing wants of
the Museum. The prompt and liberal response to the requirements then made has produced most valuable results. It has
been enlarged and improved more than before for several
years. The ne, cases in the Zoological Department are filled,
and much material formerly useless has been put into good condition. The annual statement of its condition made to me by
Prof. Winchell, I append to this Report.
The state of the finances, at present, until the new Law and
Medical Buildings are paid for-and not even then without
enlarged resources-will not allow any further considerable
improvement of the Museum.
The General Library has been preserved in good condition,
and some valuable additions have been made. The experiment of keeping the Library open during the proper hours of
study, both daytime and evening, has met with encouraging
success. Many students avail themselves of this privilege, and
at all hours when open, some may be found in the Library
room.

The Law Library has been enlarged by a liberal donation by
Hon. Richard Fletcher of Boston.
In response to this gratifying recognition of the usefulness
of the University by one in a distant State, and in recognition
of the eminent ability of the donor, the fourth Professorship
in the Department of Law has been designated as the Fletcher
Professorship.
It is evident from the frequent and complimentary allusions
to the University of Michigan in various periodicals of the
country, and in the addresses and writings of eminent educators, that is now generally regarded as one of the mostflourishing
Universities in America. Astonishment is often expressed at
its rapid growth within the past few years, at the great number
of its students, and at its exemption from a class of difficulties
growing out of political differences of opinion, which have
been deemed by some inseparable fiom a State University.
The criticisms and eulogies upon the University have not however always exhibited correct views of its character.
The University of Michigan is designed simply to complete
the system of public education in the State, by offering to its
youth opportunities for study and discipline, to succeed those
presented by the highest departments of our Union Schools.
It is not modeled after any other College or University, but
aims to supply the existing demand.
The preparatory studies required for admission are supposed
to be those which can or ought to be easily pursued in all the
Union Schools of the State. It is a deserved reproach upon
any Union School in Michigan, if it cannot prepare pupils for
both the classical and the scientific courses of study pursued
in the University. Many of our students also are from other
States.
Entering the University, the student finds several parallel
courses offered, 1more 0 less independent, and more or less connected with each other. No preference is expressed for one
above another, but the student is supposed to be mature enlough
to choose for himself a pathiway, -wich, after lie has made his
selection, le is expected faithfully to pursue. The old classi

cal degree of Bachelor of Arts is to be earned in the thorough
way, with no lightening of its burdens, or substitution of some
modern superficial study for the genuine classical languages and
mnathemlatics and philosophy, which it is rightly supposed to indicate. The degree of Bachelor of Science must be earned by
a rigid course of study. Civil Engineer and Mining Engineer
are degrees given only to those who are fitted to accomplish
all that could be justly expected in their professions. It is intended that all the certificates given to those who complete
colcrses of study shall be thoroughly deserved.
The University of Mlichigan has also adopted the method of
treatinl its students as competent and inclined to perform their
duties, without an appeal to the puerile ambition engendered by
rank in classes, and prizes and medals, and other such rewards
of merit. It is doubtful whether these even promote good
scholarship in the general, and it is certain that they engender
strife and envy, if not hatred, and tend also to lower the proper
self-respect of all who are influenced by them. The proper
stimulants to study are not medals, or position in class, or prizes,
but the gratification produced by an enlarged acquaintance
with truth, and by the greater influence for good thereby produced. Experiment in this University has demonstrated, to the
entire satisfaction of the Faculty, many of whom have been
professors and instructors in Colleges where the other system
was practiced, that the method pursued in this University produces the best general scholarship, and is inexpressibly more
valuable in its moral influence upon the students.
We do not, therefore, ask the liberal friends of education in
this State to establish prizes or scholarships for us, to stimulate
a few to extraordinary efforts and to discourage the many. We
should be reluctant to accept any such gift, but we should be
pleased to receive a fund for the endowment, in part or in
whole, of the M1useum, or Library, or Observatory, or for the
endowment of any Professorship, or for any legitimate purpose of advantage to the University.
Many of our students, in all the Departmlents, are from other
States. So large now is the attendance that we have been

obliged to increase the number of our recitation and lecture
rooms and enlarge them, increase the number of our Ins:tructors, and in many ways greatly add to our expenses. It is,
therefore, proper that the fees charged for incidental expenses
should be made to cover the actual expenditures.
The Departments of Medicine and Surgery, and of Law,
have both been remarkably successful durinll the vela. A
fourth Professorship in the Department of Law has been formally established, rendered necessary by the great number of
students.
We boldly assert, that nowhere in the country, has a more
economical use of funds for ed(ucational purposes been made,
than in this State institultion. While others seem to be surprised at its success, we would express our profound gratitude
to a superintending Providence which has thus flar guided us,
and we cherish the hope, that the State, which has really done
so little by the way of contributing money, and so much by its
wise watch-care over the institution, will yet make creditable
contributions to its support; and that the time is not far distant when, as in the case of many other American Colleges,
liberal friends shall contribute largely for its improvement and
support.                          E.. HAVEN.

By a resolution of the Board, adopted Mlarch 30th, 1864, Dr.
Rominger was authorized to deposit this cabinet in the cases
of the University. The cabinet constitutes almost our only
illustration of extinct faunas which play a most important part
in the geology of the old world; and furnishes a most welcome
accessory to the geological student. The cabinet is offered to

The employment of a Taxidermist in the Museum, during
the past season, has been made the occasion of adding quite a
number of new specimens to the Zoological Collection, of
which, with others, an account is given below:
Mr. J. T. COLEMAN has made donations as follows:
1 Fish Hawk, (_candion carolinensis.)
Nest and eggs of American Coot, (FTulica Almericanat.)
do of Blue Jay, (Cy(J'ur' a cristata.)

1 Egg of African Ostrich, (Struthio camelus.)
Mr. Coleman has also collected fresh specimens of 27 birds
and one serpent, among which:are the White Heron, (IIerodias
Enrettca) the American Raven, (Corvus carnivorous) and the
AMourning Warbler, (Geothll/pis P/tiladelp/tia)-the latter being new to the collection, and the others being used to replace
inferior specimens.
There have also been procured by purchase 15 fiesh specimens of birds, of which the Whip-poor-Will (Antrostomrus
vociferzts) is new to the collection; two Manmmals, of which
the Woodchuck (Arctomy s il3ona)x) is new to the collection;
one Black Massasauga (Crotatop/hor2ns ATirtlandii) also new,
and one Dog Fish. (Amia cresembling A. calva but peculiarly
colored.)
There has also been purchased of J. T. Coleman a collection
of 24 mounted fish skins, illustrating some of the larger species
from Lake Erie.
The Smithsonian Institution has laid the Museum under renewed obligations for suites of duplicates fiom its stores. The
following packages of shells have been received:
1. "Marine Shells from the West Indies."  "Registered Collection No. S. 28."  87 species, 286 specimens.
2. "Vancouver and Californian Shells."  "Students' Series,
No. 24.' Estimated 75 species, 200 specimens.

III. BOTANY.
The most important addition to report in this Department is
the Herbarium   of Professor Abram  Sager, A.M., M. D., of
the Medical Faculty of the University. Prof. Sager coinmenced this collection while a Medical Student at New Haven,
Conn., continued it while prosecuting his further studies at
Troy, New York, and still further increased the collection, in
later years, fiom all portions of the State of Michigan. A private collection, thus accumulated as a work of love, during the
progress of a life-time, becomes closely identified with its possessor; and it is impossible for him to part with it without
something of a sense of bereavement. The collection should
therefore be sacredly preserved in its identity, as a memorial
of one of the oldest and most accomplished professors of the
University.
This Herbarium contains about 1200 species, represented
by about 5000 specimens in a good state of preservation.
Rev. L. Holzer of St. Mary's Church, Detroit, has presented
to the University 27 species of plants growing in Michigan, but
not heretofore existing in our Collection, nor embraced in any
catalogue of the plants of the State. Mr. Holzer has also furnished a catalogue of 600 species of wild plants found growing
in the Southeastern portion of the State-mostly about Detroit.

On the 2d of October, 1863, I had the honor of submitting
to the Board of Regents a statement of the growth and condition of the Museum, embracing an approximate estimate of
the total number of specimens in the various classes. It may be
interesting to note the rapid growth of the Museum during
the three years past, as sLown by the following comparative
statement:

WTORK PERFORMED.
By a resolution of' the Board of Regents, adopted March
29th, 1866, an appropriation of $100 was made to provide for
the mounting of a portion of the skins in the zoological gallery; and, by further action taken June 29th, $250 were
appropriated for the same object. Under these provisions
Mr. J. T. Coleman has been employed as Taxidermist and
Zoological Artist; and he has succeeed in adding very
materially  to  the  attractions  of the  Zoological Gallery. At the same time the nounting of a large number of
specimens in their natural attitudes, and surrounded by their
natural associations, enhances, in a great degree, the educational value of the IMuseum.  A large new case has been
nearly filled with the freshly mounted specimens, embracing
many of the old skins, and a large proportion of the fresh additions, already reported.  Groups of birds are disposed according to their native. habits, over sea-side cliffs or mimic
trees, or upon the moss-covered ground; and, while the zoological characters are perfectly preserved, to answer the purposes
of scientific study, the disposition of the specimens produces a
pleasing effect upon the eye.
The following is a synopsis of the work done in the Zoological Department:
Old skins of aquatic birds preserved and mounted on rock-work-including 2 species of
Pelican and the Florida Flamingo........ 25 specimens.
Old skins of Wading Birds mounted.......... 18    "
Group of fresh skins of Song Birds mounted on
artificial tree, with Blue Racer attacking a

All the cases of zoological specimens have also been frequently inspected, and freed froml moths and other insects, and
preservatives appilied.
Mr. Coleman hal s also repaired and cleaned 15 pieces of
statuary in plaster and terra cotft, an(d has cleaned the marble
statue of Nydia.
The collection of insects, always liable to attacks fiom various enemies, has been two or three timhes carelully inspected
and renovated. A considerable mniscell:neous collection has
been generally arranged; and the entire Order of Lepidoptera
in the Collection has been re-investigated and relabeled with
greater fullness, with special reference to the wants of students.
Besides the.:e special labors, the reception, determination, registration and preservation of the new additions, and the successful preservation of the locality-labels, constitute a daily responsibility and labor.
The work in the Geological Department of the Museum has
been continued during the year. Besides the registration and
care of the miscellaneous accessions, the collections made by
Dr. Romninger have been cleaned, investigated, and mounted
upon cards for exhibition in the cases. The work on the lithological collections has made some progress, and portions of
three duplicate suites, filling eight or ten boxes, are ready for
exchange-the first series being always retained for the University.
An investigation of considerable interest and importance,
and one occupying several weeks of time, has been made upon
the collection of fossils fiom the Hamlilton group of the western
slope of the State. These have all been carefully worked out,
labeled and placed on exhibition; and comprise some of the
best preserved of our fossils. Not less than 61 of the species

are ascertained to be new to science, and descriptions of them
have been publislled to the scientific world. The elucidation
of the geology of the northwestern slope of the peninsula, effected partly through the study of these organic remains, is the
first geological exposition which has ever been made of that
region. A copy of the published results I have the honor to
communicate for the Board of Regents. Later investigation
of these and other materials contained in the Museum has led
to the recognition of two new generic types among fossil corals-Icdiostroma and  Ccenostroma-and the erection of a
new family, Stromatoporidce, to receive these and the related
genus Stromatopora. The credit of these results was secured
to the University in a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Buffalo.
Another investigation of some importance, the results of
which have been published during the year, is the specific determination of the more common fossils in the Drift of the
southern portion of the peninsula. One disclosure made by
these researches is the fact of a northward transportation of
some of the Drift inaterials-a direction of translation quite
the reverse of that to which the great mass of the Drift has
been subjected. For the results of this investigation see the
"American Journal of Science," Vol. XL. p. 331.
The principal work done in the Botanical Collection has
been to examine the Houghton Herbarium, alter the labels to
adapt them to the present state of the science, and make out
azatalogue of the specimens.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
While the extent of the operations which we have been enabled to carry on during the past year is a creditable commentary on the enlightened liberality of the Board of Regents, and
no inconsiderable service rendered to the cause of education
and the cause of science, it does not appear that the means
placed at the disposal of this Department are more than commensurate with the most pressing demands of higher education, or with the efforts which other colleges and universities
are making in furtherance of the interests of the same branches of science.

I would, therefore, respectfully recommend that some appropriation be made f  for  rther increasing the collections in geology during the ensuing year, either by the procuring of new
specimens, or making part payment for the Rominger Collection, now on deposite.
I would also recommend the continuance of Mr. Coleman as
taxidermist, custodian and general assistant in the Museum;
and I believe an arrangement to this effect may be made without creating any additional charges upon the University.
The means solicited by me last spring for the construction of
additional cases to accommodate the geological specimens, and
permit the continued transfer of the collection to the room destined for its reception, were, under the circumstances arising,
employed in the zoological gallery. The want of new geological cases remains, therefore, unsupplied, and is even more
pressing than before.
A cheap case of drawers is also needed for duplicate specimens.
A suitable case is required for the accommodation of our
18,000 specimens of dried plants which are now kept, partly in
the general library, partly in my lecture-room and partly in
my laboratory; while the Sager Herbarium has not yet been
delivered for want of accommodations. A suitable case might
cost $40.
A cabinet of glazed drawers is also needed for the accommodation of the collection of Insects, which, for want of such
accommodation can not be suitably exhibited nor effectually
preserved.  When such a cabinet is provided, Mr. Austin
stands ready to supply a very considerable collection of labeled specimens. Fifty dollars would fully meet the expense.
A rough, inclosed case should also be provided for the
mounted birds selected for the use of students.

The President read the following memorial, which was accepted and ordered on the Minutes, with the approval of the
Board.
UNIVERSITY OF MICIIGAN, 
ANN ARRoR, September 26th, 1866.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan:
The undersigned begs leave respectfully to suggest to the
Board of Regents for their earnest consideration:
1. That the time has come when the most imperative necessity calls for an effort to increase the endowment fund of the
University. Its departments have all been planned with reference to its income, upon the supposition that our currency
would always retain a uniform value. That value has within
the past four years been reduced to about one-half, and it is
therefore no longer possible to carry on and develope the institution upon the scale of its original plan, without an increase
of income.
2. All the better class of Eastern institutions have, by magnificent donations and bequests, increased their endowment
funds by from $100,000 to $400,000 within 3 or 4 years past,
and have laid their plans and estimated their expenses accordingly.
3. The immense reputation which this University has acquired of late, as expressed, to cite no other instances, in the
address of Dr. Hedge at Cambridge, produces in tle minds of
thoughtful fiiends, fil' less of gratification than of fearful apprehension; for this reputation must sooner or later attract an



</P>
<P><PB REF="00000183.tif" SEQ="00000183" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="872" N="187" DISPLAYN="187" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=umregproc;idno=acw7513.1864.001;debug=xml;c=umregproc;seq=183"/>
187


attention and a scrutiny which will surely reveal the fiet that
the University wants the means to enable it to fulfill the magnificent promises involved in its reputation.
4. That as one of the plans for an increase of income, some
particular department which may be deemed most likely to
furnish a good basis for appeal to the public or to the State legislature, should be taken up and an effort made to secure a
special endowment for such department or departments.
5. It is respectfully suggested that the Library is such a department. The privileges of class and lecture rooms belong
only to students. The Library is free to all who choose to consult it. There may be numerous libraries established il this
State, and some of them may number more volumes than that
of the University, but they will be mainly for popular reading,
or for some limited or technical investigations, while this
should be made and always kept up as the Library of this State
for general and original learned and scientific investigations.
On these grounds a strong appeal can be made. This very
morning since he began the writing of this paper, the Librarian has been occupied for an hour with a learned gentleman
from a neighboring city, who is pursuing such investigation as
is referred to above.
7. It will be quite in place to add that the undersigned has
just had an interview with the Chairman of a Committee of
the Alumni, appointed in June last for the purpose of memorializing the Legislature with regard to endowment. He says
that he desires to act in concert with the governing power of
the University, and make any benefit which may arise from the
labors of the Committee meet the immediate and most urgent
wants of the institution.
Very Respectfully,
ANDREW TEN BROOK.
SEPTEMIBEIER 26th, 1866.
On motion of Regent Willard, the resolution presented by
him yesterday in relation to preparing an address to the
people of the State, was taken from the table and adopted.

by the following vote: Ayes, Regents Gilbert, Knight, Johnson, Sweezey, Stockwell, Walker and Willard.
On motion of Regent Walker, Regent Knight was requested

Superintendent of Public Instruction.

University of Michigan, having been instructed to prepare re.
solutions upon the acceptance of the resignation of Professors
Gunn and Armor of the Medical Faculty, and of Professor
White of the Literary Faculty, respectfully present the following:
]Resolved, That while we reluctantly accept the resignation
of Professor Moses Gunn, M. D., who, first as Professor of
Anatomy for two years, next as Professor of Anatomy and
Surgery for two years, next as Professor of Surgery for thirteen years, has devoted his eminent ability and energy to the
Department of Medicine and Surgery of this University, from
1848, the year of its foundation, to the present time, and to
whose skill as a Surgeon and eloquence as a Professor, the
Department is so greatly indebted, we desire to express our
high appreciation of his eminent services, and our strongest
wishes for similar, and, if possible, superior success in his future labors, wherever he may be.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, signed by the
President and Secretary, be presented to Dr. Gunn.
Resolved, That Samuel G. Armor, M. D., Professor of
Institutes of Medicine and Materia Medica for the last six
years, in the University of Michigan, has successfully performed the duties of his professorship to the entire satisfaction of
all, and has achieved a high reputation as a Professor.
Resolved, That we accept his resignation with sincere regret, lightened, however, by the thought that elsewhere he
will be employing the same ability in the same work.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, signed by the
President and Secretary, be presented to Dr. Armor.

IIon. Andrew D. White is compelled by other and stronger demands upon him, to resign the Professorship of History and

English Literature in this University, a chair which he has filled
for several years so honorably both to himself and to the University.
Resolved, That so long as the most important features of the
history of this University are preserved, so long will his labors,
counsels, and contributions in its behalf be remembered, and
that now, called upon as he is to superintend the foundation of
another great State University, to correspond in its magnitude
and influence, we hope, with the Empire State, whose patronage and support it will enjoy, we congratulate him on being invited to a field where his talents and energies may be so successfully employed, and we hope and expect that he will be
blessed with great success.

Remarks were made by professors Evans, Watson, Wood,
Adams, and Douglass.
Regent VWalker presented the following preamble and resolutions, which were adopted:
Whereas, The Legislature has passed an act extending aid
to the University, by an annual tax, upon condition of appointing one Professor of Homeopathy in the Medical Department
of the University of Michigan; and
Whereas, The appointment of such a Professor to be a
member of the Faculty of Medicine, as now constituted, would,
in the opinion of this Board, not accomplish the result of a
proper development of the principles and practice of Homeopathic Medicine, and would endanger, if not entirely destroy
the existing department, built up at so much expense, and with
so much labor, and with such distinguished success; and
Whereas, The wisest plan for the benefit of the Homeopathic school of Medicine is, in the opinion of the Board, to
establish a separate school of Homeopathic Medicine, at some
other point in the State than at Ann Arbor, which this Board
is desirous and willing to do from the funds to be so provided
by the State; and
Whereas, In the present state of the law, it is doubtful in
the minds of some whether it is competent for the Board to
organize a school of Homeopathy, away from Ann Arbor, and
whether such action would be in fact a compliance with the
spirit and conditions of the grant; and
Whereas, Under the terms of the act the tax will be levied
and collected in any event, and the condition is imposed only
upon the payment of the money, which will not be in the State
Treasury till a year from this time, and there is reason to believe that the Legislature will sit in January next; therefore
Resolved, That the consideration of this subject be postponed
till the Spring meeting of 1868, and that the Executive Committee at once prepare a brief statement and appealto the
people and the Legislature, showing the reasons that have
heretofore prevented our appointment of a Homeopathic Professor, the absolute necessity to the University of the aid
granted, and asking that the Legislature will so modify the condition imposed that the Board of Regents may establish a
school of Homeopathic Medicine, distinct from the present
Medical Department, at some other point than Ann Arbor.
Regent Willard presented the following preamble and resolution, which were adopted:
Whereas, There have been certain petitions presented to the
Board of Regents by women, asking admission to the thorough

courses of instruction afforded in the different departments of
the University; and
Whereas, It is evident that the public mind, and the attention of educators, both in this country and in Europe, has been,
of late, to a very large extent, turned to the consideration of
this subject; and
Whereas, The Legislature of AIichigan, at its late session,
expressed an opinion upon this question, in the passage of the
following resolution:
'" Resolved, That it is the deliberate opinion of this Legislature that the high objects for which the University of Michigan was organized will never be fully attained, until women
are admitted to all its rights and privileges;" and
Whereas, the question thus raised, and presented to this
Board, is one of great practical importance, involving a fundamental change in the policy of the University, upon this particular, and one which demands wise and prudent consideration; therefore,
Resolved, That the Executive Committee of the Board of
Regents be instructed to consider this subject, and at some future time report whether the regulations relating to the admission of students to the different departments of the University,
and to the conferring of degrees, should not be so construed as
not to exclude women, residing in the State of Michigan, fiom
the right of matriculation, and to become candidates for graduation upon the same conditions, and with the same requirements as are demanded of men.
The President presented the resignation of Dr. W. Lewitt,
Demonstrator of Anatomy, which was accepted.
Regent Joslin, from the Committee on the Museum; made a
partial report on the communication of Prof. Winchell, and
asked leave to report further at the next meeting of the Board,
which was granted.
Regent Stockwell, from the Committee on the Medical Department, to whom was referred the recommendations of sundry applicants for appointments to fill vacancies in the Medical
Faculty, have had the same under consideration, and would
recommend the appointment of Professor William Warren
Greene, of the Berkshire Medical College, to the chair of Surgery, and that the remaining appointments be deferred till the
meeting in June next, which was adopted.
On motion of Regent Willard, the sum of $268.75 was

verbal report relative to the ownership of the property in the
museum, and also presented the following statement fromn Professor Sager, which was read and ordered to be entered on the
Journal:"1Ion.1 J. EASTMAr.t JOHNSON, Regent University of Michigan:
"The subjoined statement comprises about all the informiation in my possession relative to the various means of illustration contained in the Museum of the Medical Department, viz:
"1st. The south, west, and north wall cases of the South
Room of the Museum, are occupied by collections of shells
and anatomical specimens, both normal and pathological. The
eastern small division of the north side, consisting almost
wholly of specimens of diseased structure, were deposited iu
the Museum by the late Dr. Carr of Canandairgu, some ten
or twelve years ago. It is a valuable collection, comprising
some sixty or seventy specimens in glass jars. Of its present
ownership I am not informed. All other portions of the collections in these cases are claimed by Prof. Ford, a considerable
partof which was brought by Dr. Ford from the East; the remainder has been added since his connection with the University; some by donations from students and fiiends; others by his
own efforts. All other collections in this room belong to the University, and consist of an extensive and very valuable collection of specimens in materia medica, contained in glass bottles
and jars. The larger portion of this collection was secured by
purchase, and designated as the Louisiana collection; the remainder was presented at various times by different manufacturers of drugs and pharmaceutists.
"In the North Room, the entire north wall and the east half
of the south wall are occupied by plates, firamed and glazed;
designed to illustrate changes of structure by disease, and also
the living plants of the materia medica. These belong to the
University by purchase, and furnishing the means of preservation and exhibition; about twenty or twenty-five of the same
series of pathological plates are now in the rooms of the Professors of Surgery and Anatomy, where are also deposited two
small cases of models representing the various diseases of the
eyes-probably fifty or sixty specimens. These were procured
in conformity with express stipulation, by Dr. WVm. Lewitt, as
his annual donation on receiving his appointment of Demon

strator of Anatomy. In the wall case, at the east end of the
North Room, there, are 103 specimens in bottles. Of these,
75 belong to me, the remaining 28 to the University, all, I
think, by donation fiom various persons. In the case at the
North-East corner of this room are contained various anatomimical specimens labelled with the name of Dr. Milne, formerly
an assistant in anatomy.
In the wall case at the West end of the room are 228 specimens, chiefly in bottles. Of these 214 belong to me, and 14 to
the University, also by donation.
The south wall case contains anatomical specimens, which,
with the exception of a disarticulated and adjusted skull, and,
perhaps, also, one or two complete dried and injected preparations of the entire body, are understood to belong to Professor Ford. Of the floor cases, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, containing casts
of pathological specimens, wax preparations, &amp;c., all belong to
the University, by purchase chiefly. Floor cases Nos. 5, 6,
and 7, contain chiefly specimens in comparative anatomy,
mainly of mammals, birds and reptiles. Of these 22 belong to
the University by donation, and 316 to me. The vertical floor
case contains 33 specimens that belong to the University, and
187 to myself.
"In reference to the specimens claimed by me, I would observe that they have been prepared at various times; many of
theni even before I came to Michigan to reside, some thirtyfive years ago; but the larger part during the summer vacations; a considerable part being derived fiom my private practice. Whatever specimens have been sent to me as a Professor
in the University, have been credited to the institution, while
such only as have been received as testimonials of personal
friendship are claimed as personal property.
" Respectfully submitted,
"A. SAGER.

Ford relative to the sale of his collections in the Medical Museum, referred to the Committee on the Medical Department.

bT the Honorable BoardC of Regents:
Since my last annual report, I have planted twenty-eight
maple trees, one Lombardy poplar, two American weeping
willows, thirty-five large Norway spruce, and ten elms, besides seven hundred and seventy-one smaller evergreens, Norway spruce forming a most useful and ornamental evergreen
hedge on the north, south, and west fronts of the grounds.
One hundred and twenty-five of the latter were to replace
those which ha, e died during the past winter. Various trees
have been transplanted within the campus. A new seven feet
wide gravel walk, from  the North College to the Medical
Building, and two angling gravel walks, four feet wide, fiom
the centre of the coal wagon road, between the north and
south buildings, to the west front, have been constructed and
properly graded, and the two main walks have been newly
gravelled; also, a new coal ash walk, eight feet wide, from
the west corner of the Medical Building to out-house, has been
constructed.
The roofs of' three of the dwellings, the Law building, and
the north and south buildings, have been thoronghly painted
with two coats each of "Prince's Patent Metallic Roof Paint,"
which has thus far fully answered its high recommendation.
This work has saved to the University more than double its
cost in thc repairing of the tin. The dwellings have been repaired and painted to some extent, so tlat nowr, externally,
they are in good order.
The main Observatory building and also the east wing h1ave
been newly roofed with a substantial iron covering and other
repairs which were needed for the protection of the instruments, have been made. Six class rooms in the south building have been repaired, papered and curtained, and one (Professor Olney's) furnished entire with new seats, platformls,
tables and black boards. These rooms are occupied by Professors Wood, Williams, Chapin and Olney's classes. A small
portion of the hall floors antd the tread(s on tlie stairs have
been made new, and a considerable portion is still required
before the beginning of tlle term. Additional new seats and
tables are wanted in several of the class rooms; those now
in use are cut and hacked so bad as to render them entirely
unfit for further use. If new seats are decided upon, I would
recommend the iron standard, with oak slats, similar to those
in Professor Olney's room. They are less expensive and far
more durable than the all wood seat, and occupy less room.
Professor Wood needs more room for his drawing classes.
The one directly over the present dr.awing room, is the most
suitable on account of the light it affords.
A new cistern to receive the water (now allowed to waste)
fiom the south building ought to be constructed. This would
provide a convenient supply of water, in case of fire.

New and substantial oak shelving with wire doors, for the
"Fletcher Donation," of law books in the law library,, have
been constructed, and a number of new desks for the law lecture room have been put in, and new matting to replace the
worn out parts. The unusual large number of students in the
Law Department the past year, and the constant tramping, has
worn out the greater portion of the matting on the floor. I
contemplate taking up what remains, and by piecing, perhaps,
obtain enough to carpet the aisles only. The castings in the
seats and desks ave altogether too light, and are continually
breaking. Better and more substantialseats and desks should
be placed there. I submit herewith a design which allows
the seat to fly back when not occupied, allowing ample room
to move in and out with ease. Every seat was filled last year,
and extra tables were supplied for the accommodation of the
students in the Law Department. Extra Gas fixtures and
racks for newspapers have been put in the General Library
room by direction of the Library Committee. If three centre
gas pendants (which are needed) in the Library room, were
put in, the room would then be cheerfully and well lighted,
which would attract large numbers who would not otherwise
come, in the evening. The heaters are taxed to their utmost
capacity to keep the Library and Lecture rooms at all comfortable during the cold weather; they require the most careful
watching. The castings are too light, and new plates are supplied often. If any change in warming this building is contemplated, I would recommend steam as better, more economical and safer. Coal is now used exclusively for fuel in this
building, except in the two society rooms above. Additional
shelving in the General Library room is needed.
The walls in several places will need repairing this sumnmer,
the plaster having fallen off:
We want immediately about 4,000 feet of two-inch plank to
repair the long walk leading to the Medical building, and also
along the west front of the south building, the present walk is
worn out and unfit for further use.
The grounds have never before appeared so beautiful as
now, and if properly cared for, will, in a few years be an ornament to the University and to the State. I have loosed the
turf about the roots, and mulched with new mown grass nearly
all the trees. They are growing finely, and when the Norway
spruce hedge shall be grown up, the grounds will present
the most invitinr appearance. Something is needed to improve the turf. The soil needs enriching. Experienced agriculturists with whom I have conversed say the best we can do
is to mow the grass say once in two weeks, beginning about
the middle of May, and continuing until September; besides
this, I think, if the grounds could be harrowed with a heavy



</P>

iron harrow, to level and smooth them, sow timothy and white
clover, it would greatly improve the turf and give us a fine
smooth lawn. The cost of mowing each time by hand, is about
$75. The estimated cost of one of Swift's one-horse improved
lawn mowing machine, is $230, which combines a cutter and
roller at the same time, and can be used about the trees without injury. I will add, this one is used at the Central
Park, in  New   York, with the most satisfactory result.
With   this  machine. we could mow the grass as often
as necessary, and   at the same   time roll the surface,
should we continue to mow by hand, as it is usually done,
three times per year, it would cost $225 per year; so that in
one year the machine would pay for itself.
Allow me, in conclusion, to call your attention to the subject
of fuel for warming the several buildings. The price of wood
has increased to three times the cost of four years ago. First
quality of hickory or maple now commands $8 per cord, and
beach and oak sell readily for $6- to $74 per cord. The supply of wood in this vicinity is not equal to the demand. Anthracite coal is more economlical, and must sooner or later take
tlhe place of wood. Should coal, as a fuel for all the buildings,
be contemplated, whether used in stoves, or in connection with
steam apparatus, the present supply of wood stoves, could be
sold at a fair price. We have now nearly enough wood on
hand to carry us through this year.

right. It needs no monument of granite to perpetuate the
memory of those noble men and their deeds of heroic darino
and suffering. Their memories " still live" and will live in the
hearts of a preserved and gratefil people. Many, alas! have
fallen on the field of battle in the foremost ranks, aye, at the
very cannon's mouth, while some have sickened and died of disease or perished in rebel dungeons.
Flung to the viewless winds,
Or on the waters cast,
Their ashes shall be watched,
And gathered at the last;
While from their scattered dust,
Around us and abroad —
Shall spring a precious seed,
Of witnesses for God."
The labor to perfect this work has been difficult and ardu
ous. Copies of the same, when completed, have been requested by the General Government at Washington and by various States of our Union, North and South.
In connection with the Roll of Honor I contemplate preparing a record which is intended to embrace the individual history of each soldier, during the war, which it is hoped will
form a contribution to the biography of the graduates and students of our University many of their adventures and escapes
from Southern prison pens, and re-capture by blood-hounds,
will form abundant material.

Present-President Iaven, Regents Gilbert, Joslin, Sill,
Johnson, and Willard.
The meeting was opened with reading the Scriptures and
prayer by the President.
The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.
The President read his Annual Report to the Board, also a
statement made to him by Professor Winchell, of the wants of
the Museum and the additions made to it during the past year,
which was accepted and ordered to be printed in the minutes.
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT.
During the year closing June 26, 1867, the University has
had a larger number of Students in each and all of its Departments than ever before. The following is the summary, as
given in the Catalogue, published near the first of January,
which might properly be enlarged, as a few students entered
after that time, but in my Annual Reports, for convenience,
and to avoid conflicting statements, I prefer to take the numbers published in the Annual Catalogue:

So large a number of young men-the largest attending
any University in the country-have not been accommodated
without difficulty. The recitation and lecture-rooms of the
Literary Department have been in some instances inconveniently crowded, the passage ways and stair ways in the old
building originally designed for dormitories, now used for recitation and lecture-rooms, are too narrow for the multitudes
that pass and repass each other there. We have been compelled to divide some of the classes which are pursuing the
same studies, into sections, thus increasing the labor of the
instructors. But our greatest inconvenience arises fiom the
want of a room on the University premises large enough to
accommodate one-half of all the Students together, so that it
is never possible to hold a meeting of them all. Probably
there is no other university in the country without a room
large enough to accommodate its Faculty and Students assembled together. It is impossible for us to assemble, even

for religious worship, for the want of a place, but the members of each Department, or a selected number, must meet
by themselves.
The courses of study pursued in the Literary Department
have been prospectively enlarged, as new demands have
arisen. For several years the University has escaped all
trouble from the chronic and seemingly interminable discussion
between the defenders of classical and scientific learning,
respectively, by liberally providing for both impartially, and
by allowing each department to stand on its own merit.
In 1852 the University was largely remodeled by the State,
and it was then enacted that "the Regents shall provide for
the arrangement and selection of a course or courses of
study, for such students as may not desire to pursue the usual
collegiate course, in the Department of Science, Literature
and the Arts, embracing the ancient languages, and to provide
for the admission of such students without previous examination as to their attainments in said languages, and for granting
such certificates at the expiration of such course or term of
such students as may be appropriate to their respective attainments." The Scientific Course was then established by the
Regents, and has had now sixteen years of trial. In 1858 a
Course of Study in Civil Engineering was established, and in
1864 a Course in Mining Engineering. The result of these
experiments has been very gratifying. The old time-honored
Classical Course of Study, instead of being diminished and
marred, as it would be if the demands for lessening the
amount of the study of Latin and Greek were yielded to, and
all the students were required to adhere to one course of
study, is maintained and perfected according to the desires of
its fiiends; and by the various provisions of parallel courses
of study the wishes of all parties are met.
It has been found by experiment that a still greater variety
of study should be provided for, and therefore a new schedule
has been drafted, to apply hereafter, providing for six parallel
courses of study, denominated the Classical Course, the
First Scientific Course, the Second Scientific Course, the
Latin and Scientific Course, Civil Engineering, and Miling'

Engineering. Itis the purpose of the University honestly to
furnish to young men who complete the studies pursued at the
High Schools in the State, opportunities to prosecute their
studies farther in any direction which they may choose. It is
probably this characteristic-the breadth and liberality and
impartiality of its courses of study, and at the same time the
honesty with which it has maintained a proper scholarship by
not admitting students too poorly prepared, or who could more
properly pursue their studies in the Union Schools, and by insisting upon the maintenance of good scholarship in the several classes, —that has given to this Department of the University its high reputation. This reputation will be maintained, and in precise proportion to the means at command will
the University of Michigan meet the wants of the people.
Some changes have taken place in the Faculty of this Department. A. K. Spence, formerly Assistant Professor of
Greek and French, is appointed Professor of the French Language and Literature. C. K. Adams, formerly Assistant Professor of History and Latin, is appointed Professor of History, and S. W. Robinson, formerly Assistant in Civil Engineering, is appointed Assistant Professor of Mining Engineering and Geodesy, and M. L. D'Ooge is appointed Assistant Professor of the Ancient Languages. Moses Colt Tyler
also has been elected Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature.
The enlargement of the Astronomical Observatory is now
going on, provided for by donations amounting to $3000 from
liberal friends in Detroit, and an equal sum from the City of
Ann Arbor, $500 of which is to be expended for improvement
of the streets. The Chemical Laboratory also has been enlarged, and nevertheless is not competent to accommodate the
great number of students who wish to avail themselves of its
excellent advantages.
The additions made to the Museum have been creditable, as
will be seen by the Report to me by Prof. Winchell, and presented herewith. The improvements needed in this Department will be made, from time to time, as the means aippropriated to its support, will allow.

The Department of Medicine and Surgery was during the
past year more largely attended than ever before. Five hundred and twenty-five students attended the lectures, of whom
eighty-two graduated as Doctors of Medicine. Though no
formal literary examination of the candidates for matriculation
was required, except a statement in writing of their previous
studies, yet several applicants were rejected as unprepared. There can be no doubt that the honor of the AMedical
Profession would be guarded, and some of the best interests
of the community would be promoted, if all the Medical
Schools in our country would insist upon it, that no one should
be recognized as a Student of Medicine who has not passed a
satisfactory examination in a certain specified course of scientific and literary study. A certain standard should be maintained, and then still greater advancement be encouraged. No
rigidity of merely professional requirements can be a substitute for this. Proficiency in Professional Study, even if it
were possible without a good literary and scientific foundation,
and in some essential respects it is not possible-could not
take the place of a thorough general preparation of the student by a liberal education. The University of Michigan will
always be found ready to cooperate with others in this direction, and with or without cooperation will exert its influence to
bring about this result.
At the close of this year Moses Gunn, M. D., Professor of
Surgery, resigned his place, having been a member of the
Faculty from its organization in 1848. The University is
largely indebted to Dr. Gunn's skillful and earnest labors, and
now parts with him with great regret. William WV. Greene,
M. D., has been elected in his place, Professor of Civil and
Military Surgery. Dr. Greene graduated in the Medical Department of this University in 1845, and has enjoyed extensive
experience in practice and as a Professor, and we are fortunate in being able to secure the services of one known to be
fully competent for the post. William Lewitt, M. D., has also
resigned his position as DeImonstrator of Anatomy, a place
which he has held with success and credit, since 1858. The

great increase in the number of Students and in the work demanded has led to the appointment of Dr. Henry W. Cheever
as Demonstrator of Anatomy, and Dr. A. G. Frothingham as
Prosector of Surgery and Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy, both of whom are graduates of this University.
The great and unparalleled prosperity of this Department,
the undoubted good influence which it has had upon the Medical Profession, the scores of graduates which it has sent out
who have won high positions in the army and in all parts of
the country, would render it inexcusable and suicidal to admit
any radical changes into its constitution or mode of operation.
No such change has been contemplated, or could for a moment
be thought of. When it was established it took at once the
highest ground to secure a thorough preparation for the Profession, and to afford the best possible medical education. The
only changes admissible are such as may be required, from
time to time, to keep pace with, and lead in the advancement
of science and practice at home and abroad.
The relation of the Department to a modification suggested
by the Legislature of the State will be considered in another
part of this Report.
The Department of Law has been so regularly prosperous
as to require but little attention. No changes have been made
in the Faculty. Two of its Professors are Justices of the
Supreme Court of the State, one Judge of the Third Judicial
Circuit of Michigan, and the fourth a practicing Lawyer in
Detroit. The instruction afforded is not only broad and comprehensive in theory, but preeminently practical. The large
number of Students shows how the school is appreciated in all
parts of the country. It is inconvenient to the Department
that a large part of the building is employed for the General
Library, and that the only Chapel for the University is the
Law Lecture Room, which will accommodate only about five
hundred persons. This is one of the embarrassments arising
from the fact that the State of Michigan will not afford us adequate buildings. A sum of one hundred thousand dollars is
imperatively needed to give us fair room to meet the demands
of the University.

Having thus noted the three Departments of the University
in order, I desire to submit some suggestions of a general
character. In this Report I purposely omit all theoretical
disquisitions upon educational questions, upon which discussion is so common and interminable, and confine attention to
practical matters which our constituents, the people of the
State, to whom the University belongs, ought to understand.
A respectful and earnest Memorial was presented by me, in
accordance with the request of your Honorable Body, to the
Legislature of the State, at its last session. In this Memorial
the wants of the University were set forth, and also the fact
that only one hundred thousand dollars had ever been given
to the University by the State, which was originally in the
form of a loan, and upon which the University paid seven per
cent. interest annually for many years, and also that the original price of many of the lands belonging to the University
had been reduced by the State, so that in fact this aid
has not ultimately added to its income, though it was a great
advantage at the time. For this the State University is and always should be grateful. It was also shown that now, the
day of preparation and of the laying of a foundation being
past, the University, with its present reputation and success,
is in a condition to make a most profitable use of additional aid.
One thousand dollars now would be more immediately and permanently productive of good results than ten thousand dollars
when the foundation was being laid. The action of many
other States which are expending large sums in creating universities, demonstrates that, had they the foundation to build
upon which Michigan has, it would not be long before they
would present universities superior to anything yet seen in this
country.
These representatives were respectfully listened to by the
Legislature, and the Memorial was printed by their order.
The Committees on Education most heartily and unanimously
approved the request. The discussions generally evinced a
gratifying interest in the institution. And yet some objections were made in discussion and are now occasionally repeated by a few persons.

It is intimated that the University is aspiring and endeavors to absorb or overshadow other institutions of learning,
Nothing can be more false and unreasonable. That the University is prosperous of course is acknowledged. But is this
a crime? Must it put itself into the position of a feeble, perishing thing to excite sympathy? It asks aid, not because it
will perish, not even because it will positively retrograde
without it, but because it is in position to use well any additional resources, because it needs more room and capital to
use its reputation and opportunities for the greatest possible
result, and because if not aided, other State Universities will
soon surpass it.
It is not unfriendly to other institutions of learning in the
State. It rejoices in their success. It thrives in the healthy
spirit which itself and they together engender and encourage.
It rejoices in their growth. They have their friends to depend
upon, to whom shall it look but the State? If the question is
put to it how it could use funds to accomplish certain ends,
whether for agricultural education or any other purpose, of
course it must make a truthful dreply. No honest man desires
to build up any institution except on a basis of truth, and it is
my duty to state the facts.
It is also suggested that the expenditure of money by the
State in the University is uncalled for, because its advantages
are shared so largely by Students from other States. It is
true that the University of Michigan, in common with the
leading universities of Europe and America, attracts students
from afar. The facts are that out of the 1255 reported in the
last Catalogue, 373 were from Michigan, and 882 from other
States. Now the amount of money received from the admission and annual fees of the students from abroad was $15,960,
while that received from Michigan Students was only $3,745,
Take away the money received from foreign students, and allow that that the expense for buildings would be diminished
one-third, and still the loss would be so great that not more
than two-thirds of the present Faculty could be employed.
The University would at once sink to such a grade that it
could not command the present number of Michigan Students.

No benefit could result, in this liberal age, from degrading a
University which was founded by a grant from the United
States, to a limited local patronage, simply to avoid
a little addition by the State to the noble boon granted by the
nation. The discrimination between home and foreign students is now greater than I approve, but it has been forced
upon us as a necessity, in order to meet current expenses. The
thousands of young men, attracted hither from abroad, acquire a high estimation of Michigan. Many of them remain
within the State, others wherever they go spread its reputation, and to-day nothing within Michigan is mentioned so
often and with so great commendation without, as our State
University. Neither on moral, nor pecuniary grounds should
higher charges than at present be made to foreign students.
Even now, but for them, our Departments of Medicine and
Law could not be sustained. Higher charges would induce
some of our young men to seek their education elsewhere.
The Legislature after considering the matter, enacted a law
granting to the University an income which should arise from
a tax of one-twentieth of a mill on every dollar of the property taxed by the State. This tax of ten cents on two thousand dollars would amount at present to less than $16,000 a
year, which though small, would by careful economy enable
the University to build a Chapel, a fire-proof Library Building, and enlarge its library and museums, in the course of a
few years. It would be a trifle to the State, and with it the
University, now of no expense to the people, could not by any
person be regarded as a burden.
But even this small grant was accompanied with a proviso,
of such a nature as to render it doubtful whether the University can consistently accept it-notwithstanding its wants.
This condition is that a Professor of Homceopathy be appointed in the Medical Department.
Hitherto it has been left to the Regents of the University,
elected by the people, to establish the Courses of Study in
the various Departments, and to appoint such Professors and
Instructors as they shall deem best. In theory this duty in a
State University is at best delicate, and requires sound judg2

ment and great care. So various are the opinions entertained
by different parties, that it might appear impossible to provide for thorough instruction in all the sciences, without offending portions of the people who entertain peculiar opinions
on theological, political, philosophical, or scientific subjects.
This difficulty has been happily avoided, but should the practice be initiated of dividing this responsibility between the
Regents who are elected for a long time and responsible for
the management of the Institution, and successive Legislatures which are elected for a shorter time and burdened with
various duties, and the most of whose members, from the
nature of the case, have no personal intimacy with the University, serious conflicts of opinion must arise that will peril
and perhaps destroy the prosperity of this State Institution.
On this principle alone, and without entering into the merits
of this case in particular, it is a question of grave importance
whether the University would not be safer-notwithstanding
its necessities-to decline most respectfully to receive the
boon on this condition. Is not this great State willing to
grant aid to its University, and leave it to be managed solely
by the Board of Regents, a permanent Body, elected by the
people, and entrusted with its care by the Constitution?
With regard to this specific condition, in particular, I could
not investigate its merits without seeming at least to espouse
the cause of a particular party. I must observe, however,
that on prudential reasons alone it would be clearly impracticable to teach Homceopathy, in a manner satisfactory to its
friends, in such a School of Medicine as ours, which espouses
and teaches no exclusive theory, whether called Allopathy,
Hydropathy, Eclecticism, or by any other name. This School
teaches neither a conglomeration of conflicting theories, nor
any one in particular, but aims, in accordance with the timehonored customs of the oldest Medical Schools, to teach the
science or sciences underlying or embraced in Medicine and
Surgery. It does not and will not commit itself to teach that
disease can and must and shall be cured only homeopathically,
or allopathically, or by any other known process. It surveys
or should survey all the accumulations of the past on this sub

ject, all the ever-opening investigations of the present, and
awaits the developments of the future. The only process by
which any newly discovered method of treating disease can be
introduced into its instructions, is, by so commending itself to
attention by its reasonableness and success, as to command
assent and its proper place in the established science of the
Profession. This, it seems to me, is the only proper basis of
the theories and practice to be taught by a State University.
It has been proposed by some persons interested in the
subject that the Regents employ a Professor of Homceopathy,
in accordance with the requirement of the law granting aid to
the University, to give instruction elsewhere, or in a School
independent of the one conducted on the premises, to be supported out of the money received by the grant. The propriety of such a course will have to be considered on its own
merits, whenever any definite proposals of the kind are made.
Another subject of general interest has been presented by
the action of the Legislature of the State, recommending that
the University admit females as well as males to its advantages. This subject has once before been thoroughly discussed
by the Board of Regents. At the meeting held September
9th, 1858, a Report was presented by Regents McIntyre,
Parsons, and Baxter, and unanimously adopted by the Board
of Regents, which presents the subject exhaustively and in an
admirable spirit. Since that time, I believe, no Superintendent
of Public Instruction in the State, no Board of Visitors, nor
other authorities appointed to investigate the affairs of the
University, have recommended a departure from the policy established from the beginning. It would be impossible for me
to present the arguments for and against the proposition without repeating much of that Report. No one denies that consistency requires that a State which provides a University for
its young men should also meet the demands for a higher education by its young women. Personally, I believe that young
women should be encouragced to obtain the very highest education, and to fit themselves for many departments of industry
in which women have not generally largely participated. I
am in favor of a liberty in this respect unlimited by law. At

the same time, when it comes to a practical question whether
young ladies should be admitted and invited to enter a University already established, with a thousand students, with its
buildings, rooms, courses of study, all originated and planned
upon a different idea and with a different object, I see numerous objections; and I am confident that such a change
could not be made without a radical revolution, that would require a large expenditure of money and give a totally new
character to the University, and infallibly be attended with
a temporary breaking up of its prosperity and success. Our
buildings are not properly arranged for such a work. The
numbers would be too great unless foreign students were rigidly excluded. More courses of study would have to be
adopted, or the University would be most manifestly unfair,
to invite botl sexes to advantages prepared solely to meet the
demands of one sex, so far as any distinction of demand can
be recognized. The few experiments of the kind tried lead
all who participated in them to the conclusion that some special and expensive and careful provision must be made to
guard against great evils. This was most clearly set forth by
Hon. Horace Mann, in a letter to the Regents in 1858, while
he was at the head of a college, small in numbers compared
with this University, at which both boys and girls were admitted. President Phinney, of Oberlin College, also entertained the same views. The dangers of the system were pronounced-to use one of Mr. AMann's own terms, italicised by
himself-" terrible," and the course " not to be thought of
without a boarding-house for the young ladies."  Professor
Phinney stated that "a wise and pious matron, with such
lady assistants as to keep up sufficient supervision," would be
needed. If such are the views of men who, under the most
favorable circumstances have triecd the experimzent, on a small
scale compared with what we might expect here, and with a
younger class of students, are we prepared suddenly to take
so hazardous a step?
It should not be forgotten by those who theorize on this
matter without practical experience, or even observation, that
the life of a student is and must be in some respects an unna

tural one. It is exceptional to the general course of life, and
temporary. Boys and girls attending our public schools are
at home with their fathers and mothers. They have only the
passions of children. Men and women, older than our stu.
dents on the average, having finished their education, are generally in families, husbands and wives, with the cares and responsibilities and controlling circumstances of mature life.
But youth is a transitional period, when passion is strong, and
restraint is feeble, and if, just at this period, multitudes of both
sexes are massed together, not in families, and not restrained
by the discipline of the home circle, consequences anomalous
and not to be cultivated by an Institution supported by the
State are likely to ensue. Many of our Students board themselves in clubs; they have societies of their own, unrestrained
by special supervision.
Whether these views are correct or not, they are honestly
entertained by many who regard woman as the equal of man,
and who, like myself; would seek no more earnestly the welfare
of one than of the other. So long as these views are largely
entertained, to open the University to females would not meet
the demands of the people, because a large majority of the
people would feel morally compelled not to send their daughters there. It is too late now to make this change without a
revolution that should not be risked except under a necessity
that cannot otherwise be met. And if insisted upon, suitable appropriations of money to meet the expense should be
made. The establishment of a State College for young ladies
would reasonly and successfully meet the demand.
For these reasons I recommend that no change be made in
the regulations of the University on this matter.
The year to come is, in some respects, an experimental
year. Whether the large numbers of the students will continue in spite of the increase of charges, remains to be seen.
The increase in numbers has been so great, that it may prove
accidental. The attendance last year was nearly tiwice as
large as five years ago. Perhaps such large numbers are not

STATEMENT
OF OPERATIONS IN THE MUSEUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF " GEOLOGY, ZOOLOGY
AND BOTANY," AND THE DEPARTMENT OF " ETHNOLOGY AND
RELICS," FOR THE YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 21ST, 1867..Rev. E 0. Ha. ven, D. D. LL. D)., President of the University:
SI —I have the honor to report a gratifying amount of ac.
tivity during the past year, in those departments of the Museum placed under my charge. The means at my disposal,
however, have been considerably less than last year; and for
this reason, the amount accomplished has not been all that I
desired. By a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
September 26th, 1866, $300 were appropriated, to be expended
upon the materials of the Museum; and, at the same time, there
remained unexpended, from appropriations of the preceding
year, the sum of $331.82 to be devoted to the construction of
new cases. No other funds have been available during the entire year, except for transportation of specimens; and, in the
meantime, the exigencies of the Museum have been such that
it has been indispensible to create a small indebtedness,

I. DEPARTMENT       OF   GEOLOGY, ZOOLOGY         AND
BOTANY.
I. GEOLOGY.
By far the largest addition to the geological collection made
during the year, has been the result of an expedition to the
mining region of Lake Superior. At the earnest request of a
number of young men connected with the University, I organized a party which started on the 26th of May, and returned
to Ann Arbor on the 26th of June. The party, besides myself,
consisted of M. Jackson and T. M. Potter of the graduating
class; W. H. Boardman and C. N. Howell of the Junior class;
J. S. Scovell, A. B., (Oberlin Coll.), A. E. Dolbear, A. B.,
(0. Wes. Univ.), F. MI. Smith, F. A. Lyman, T. Entrekin, H.
R. Durkee, J. B. Tyler, A. B., (Amherst Coll.), A. E. Foote,
C. S. Starr, A. B., (Rochester Univ.), W. H. Fitch, A. B.,
(Beloit Coll.), and W. S. McHarg, of the Department of Mines;
C. H. Ward of the Michigan Agricultural College, and A. C.
Campbell of the School of Mines of Columbia College. The
party was provided, at their own expense, with two wall tents
and all other requisites for camping out. Facilities were
furnished by the University for making collections in geology,
zoology and botany. The expedition was in every respect
successful; and brought together a large collection of specimens-especially geological-as will be indicated in detail
below.
It affords me great pleasure to acknowledge that a large
share of this success is due to the liberal cooperation and aid
extended to the party by nearly every one whom wre found in
a position to help us. Besides those who will be mentioned
in connection with the donation of specimens, the thanks of
all concerned are due to John Hutchings, owner of the Steamer
Concord; M. B. Kean, owner of the Illinois; J. T. Whiting,
Agent for the Meteor; James E. Dalliba, of the Favorite;
Capt. Murch, of the Northern Light; Capt. Wilkins, of the
Northwest; Capt. McKay, of the Ontonagon, and S. P. Ely,
Vice-President of the B. de N. &amp; M. and M. &amp; O. Railroads,

for great reduction of fares to and from  Detroit, and fiom
point to point throughout the region visited; to Geo. Hardie,
Esq., Agent of the Quincy Mining Co., Hancock, and Dr. J.
C. McKenzie, President of the Caledonia Miing Co., Rockland, for valuable attention and liberal hospitalities to the whole
party; to Capt. Gilbert Johnson, Agent of the Lake Superior
Iron Mining Co., Ishpeming, for substantial aid and facilities
extended to the party during several days; to Hiram A. Burt, A.
M., (Regent elect) of Marquette, and Walter A. Northrop, of
Houghton, for storage, dockage, and transportation facilities;
to Thomas AW. Buzzo, Agcent of the Huron Mline; D. H. Ball,
Attorney, Houghton; S. G. Emerson, Mining Engineer; John
M[cChrystal, Captain, Franklin Mine; Ebenezer Rowlands,
Captain, Iron Mountain Mine; J. C. Chynoweth, Agent National Mine; George Barringer, Captain Lake Sup. Iron Min.
Co., (Sec. 16); Mrt. Forster, Agent Shelden-Columbian Mine;
Capt. Cliff, Quincy Mine, severally, for attention, information,
assistance, transportation and other facilities.
The total number of boxes and kegs of specimens collected
by the party was 136, of which 109 were sent to the University. Of the latter, 80 were from the iron region of Marquette
county, 11 from the Portage Lake Copper Region, and 17 fIom
the Ontonagon Copper Region, and one box was filled with
miscellaneous specimens. One specimen of banded jaspery
hematite, from the vicinity of Ishpeming, weighing 2,200 lbs.,
procured by the united exertions of the party, aided by Capt.
Barringer, is placed upon the University grounds in front of
the Mluseum, and constitutes an interesting exemplification of
two important geological problems which still remain unsolved.
The specimens from the Iron Region constitute the first adequate illustration as yet obtained from that region for the University, and ought to be regfarded as an indispensable acqusition. The specimens fiom the copper districts are the first
obtained within twelve years, and are very desirable, both as
embracing some new illustrations, and as exemplifying the
present state of mining development. The party collected
also zoological and botanical specimens, and relics of ancient
mining, as will be noted under those heads.

WORK PERFORMED.
IMr. J. T. Coleman has been employed in the Museum about
four and a half months. Working under my direction he has
mounted all the fresh skins which have been received, so far as
they were in a condition suitable for mounting. lie has renovated 197 old bird skins, of which 22 were selected from duplicates not heretofore on exhibition. New stands have been supplied to many of these. He has mounted on pedestals 144 old
skins, of which 86 were from the old duplicates, and about 50
from the Trowbridge Collection.  Few if any more of the
skins of the Trowbridge Collection are sufficiently perfect for
nmounting. In truth, many of those already mounted make
but a sorry appearance. It has been thought, however, that
rare and interesting skins accomplish better the objects of a
scientific museum in a mounted condition, even if defective.
Of the newly mounted skins, I have formed an educational
cabinet for the use of students, which is to occupy a case by
itself. It contains already, over 100 birds, illustrating the
principal families and genera. With the use of this cabinet,
students will no longer be under the necessity of opening the
cases of the general collection.
Mr. Coleman has also renovated 27 nests of birds and 231
eggs, of which 142 have not heretofore been on exhibition.
Unfortunately, however, a large share of the latter must for the
present remain unidentified.
The Black Bear obtained through the assistance of Regent
Walker, was partly mounted by Dr. Breakey, of Ann Arbor;
but, having to stand for several months, in consequence of the
fatty condition of the skin, the mounting was recently completed by IMr Coleman, who has represented the animal as resting

with its fore feet upon the stump of an old tree, some of the
remaining branches of which support a Canada Lynx, (new to
the collection) and a couple of squirrels.
Of the old duplicate bird skins, 40 were selected and renovated, and exchanged with Mr. William Couper, of Quebec,
for artificial eyes, valued at about 40 dollars in gold. Some
duplicate skins and mounted specimens were also sold to Solomon C. Perry for $16.
All the insects preserved in alcohol by the Lake Superior
expedition, have been pinned and arranged. The entire collection of insects has been twice thoroughly cleared of depredators, and has recently been baked at a temperature of 212
degrees to destroy the germs of moths and lDermnestidce.
All the cases containing skins have also been repeatedly ex
amined and preservatives applied-a care which can never be
remitted while we occupy the loose-jointed cases created by
the costly economy which decided in 1859 to reject the style of
fastening recommended by the Smithsonian Institution.
The Sager Herbarium has been catalogued by A. B. Lyon,
A. B., (Williams Coll.). Rev. L. Holzer, of Detroit, has furnished a supplementary list of 54 species of plants found within
the State, but not heretofore included in any catalogue of the
plants of the State.
One new double case for geological specimens has been constructed and filled. The wall cases at the south-end of the
hall are now in process of construction, and will be filled as
soon as completed. A case of drawers for duplicate geological specimens, has been obtained and partly occupied. A cabinet of 96 drawers has also been constructed for insects. I
have also obtained a set of sample bottles for the exhibition of
samples of crude petroleum and its products.
The opening, unpacking and arranging of the products of
the Lake Superior expedition, is an extensive work, and, of'
course, but partially completed.
Desirous of taking note of any recent imiprovements adopted
in the methods of arranging and exhibiting specimens in the
public museums of the east, I devoted some weeks, at private

expense, to an examination of the museums at New lHaven,
Cambridge, Boston and Salem. I have nowhere found geological specimens exhibited by any method thought to be as
satisfactory as the one which I have employed.  Some ilmproverent may be made in the exhibition of the mounted birds
-though the present method was adopted from the Smithsonian Institution, to which we have been indebted for numerous
suggestions.
I should not discharge my -whole duty in failing to impress
upon the Board of Regents, through you, the great necessity
for appropriations as liberal as can be spared for carrying oni
the operations of our really large Museum. The expansion of
this department, in common with others of the University, has
been such as to urgently demand the constant employment of
some reliable assistance. The completion of the geological
and conchological cases remains as pressing a desideratum as
ever. I feel constrained to repeat a recommendation first made
eight years ago, to construct small conchological cases around
the railing of the zoological gallery. Such cases are introduced into the new museum buildings at Cambridge and Boston; and I am as fully persuaded as ever that the idea is a good
one.

We have heretofore been frequently placed under great obligations to the Smithsonian Institution, not only for suggestions
connected with the management of the Museum and for a complete series of the publications of the Institution, but for a large
number of rare and valuable specimens of Natural History;
and perhaps most of all, for the liberal spirit of co(peration
which has always actuated its distinguished Secretary and
Assistant Secretary.

Hereto is appended the report of the Secretary marked A,
showing the numbers and amounts of the warrants on the
Treasurer issued during the year; also, the report of the
Treasurer marked B, showing the numbers and amounts of the
several warrants paid during the year, the items of receipts,
and the sources from whence received.
While it appears from the above estimate of receipts and
expenditures, that there will be in the Treasury at the end of
the fiscalyear, the sum of $8,939.73, we must remember that it is
not a surplus from the transactions of the current year, but is
about the amount remaining annually in the hands of the State
Treasurer. The actual condition of the Treasury at the expiration of the current fiscal year, based on the estimated transactions of the year, will be about as follows:
Balance in Treasury July 1, 1867..................$8,061 15
Interest on proceeds of University lands sold.......38,000 00

The Executive Committee of tlhe Univerlsity of Mlichiglan

tlhe last meeting of the Board of LReents, but few matters

of Greek, havingl accepted an invitation to aT Professorship in
the University in Chicago, left this University January 1,1808,
having by an arrangement wxith the otller professors completed
his work up to the present time. It becalel needful to employ
some additionall aid inl tle Depairtments of Latin and Greek
inasmuch as Prof: Boise lias done only tliree-fourths of the
year's work. To supply this demAandL Mr. Edward L. Waltelr,
a member of' tie Senior Class, Ihas beeni emlployed to do onefourth of the year's work for nwhich Mr. D)'Ooge is emplloyed,
for $250. IIe has enteredl upon. the work and thus far accolnplished it satisftctorily. We would recoImmend tlhat this action
be approved by tile Boaid.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL FACULTY.
To the I2.onorah1Ie 7Boaqd of Re/lents of tf/  TTnieivtrsity of
The course of lectures just closed htas been narked by no
unusual events. The conduct of students has been gool, tlhei
attention to lectures respectful and such as gives evidence of
an earnest desire to acquire a knowledge of an honorable and
responsible profession. The topics of discussion that, have
heretofore disturbed the minds of both students and professors have in a great measure ceased to be agitated; and confidence in the honor, stability and l)elranence of the Department has been restored. From causes which it is not necessary
for us to enumerate the ntnber of students has been about one
hundred less than last year, anld et the number has been sufficiently large to fill the lecture room. The Medical and Surgical clinic has been very greatly increased.  Over three hiundred cases have presented themselves for MIedical and Surgical treatment. This number is nearly six times as great as at
any previous year; anld will compare tfaorably wittl thte larogest
city schools. The F aculty are confident tlhat twith proper fostering care the clinic of the Unixversity may be made an impoltant charity of the State and of the Nortliwest, as well as an
attractive feature of tile cou1rss of instr-uction in the Department of Medicine and Sur gelr. We append a list of the diseases an  accidents treated.
'The dissecting dleplartment has never been ) more prosperous;
the change of Demonstrl'tor hlaving been pr)oductive of no
serious inconvenience. Thiis is due to the tact cand energy of
the two gentlemen who hlold the highily responsible positions
of Demonstrators. Their report to the Faiculty is herewitl
aplpended with oulr unanimouls enldorsement. In justice to tlie
I)emonstrators we invite its careftl consideration.
We respectfully call your attention to the wants of the Medlical Library, and solicit from you such liberal apropriations for
its increase as the means at your command will permit.

The Chemical Laboratory, in its extent of accommodation,
has proved entirely inadequate to meet the demand for chemical instruction. The facilities given for the study of chemistry at the University has induced no inconsiderable number
of Medical Students to seek instruction within its walls. The
preference given to special students during the past term has
excluded a large number of medical students from the privilege
of the laboratory, many of whom were attracted here for the
study of Chemistry. This has given rise to great dissatisfaction. Assurances that the laboratory would be enlarged or
that the experiment would not be repeated, have in some measure preserved quiet. WAe hope that your honorable Board will
feel that both the educational and financial interests of the
University will be subserved by an early and liberal enlargement.
We respectfully ask an appropriation of $50 for Geo. Neigler the Janitor at the Medical College.
We also ask for the usual appropriation of one hundred and
fifty dollars as an advertising fund, and would recommend its
increase to two hundred.
Your honorable Board will recollect that the question of
reforms in the systeml of Medical Education as practiced in
the Schools has been agitated for the last year or two. The
Faculty received the annexed printed circular from a committee of the convention of MIedical Colleges. After a carefill
discussion of its merits it was referred to a committee of the
Faculty. The report of that committee having been adopted
it was ordered to be transmitted to your body. It is hoped
that the whole question will receive that carefull consideration
tlhat its importance demands.

The undersigned, believing thi tht te lBoad ucan expendi tlie
monley of tlhe lUniversity mnore justly by knowingl all of its
many wants, presents the followilng state-ment.
The classes under my instruction iu (Geometrical )Drawingl
are not properly accommodated for xwant of' a suitable room in
which to conduct the exercises. The room xwhich is now used
will actco)zmodate a  boat 30 students twhile worlking at their
desks, but my class numbers 52. I have been obliged to crowd
into one room about 45, and send the remainder into another
room with another class.
The numbers have beenl graditally increasing, for the past
six years, and it is now evxident that the classes zmust be devided-thus requiring more instructors-or else a larger room
must be provided. Two years ago I suggested that one of the
residences on the north side of the Campus be appropriated to
the Civil Engineering Department, and that anl additional
story be put on so as to furnish a room of the fall size of the
building and the other parts of the buildingi be arranged
for lecture and store-rooms.  But I now think that it is
not the safest and most economical way      to   proceed.
I think that the building would not furnish all the accommodations needed for the department.    It will be better,
and in the elnd cheaper, to make a new building. At present only one large room is needed, and, by ui-ving a suitable
plan and the building properly located, tlhe; ecessary rvoom

I have not prepared plans, for the ide~a occurred to me only
qutite recently. I do not expect you will act upon this subject
at this meeting, but present it as a pressing want which must,
according to present appearances, be met, or else mIore
instructors provided.
Another consideration is worthy of note. If more instructors are employed more rooms will be needed; but all the recitation room1 s are now occupied, and if more rooms are to be
provided in new buildings or otherwise, it oulght to be for the
classes in Drawing.

thereafter as practicable, embodying therein such s  s-ggestions
and recommendations as he may deem best for the management and improvement of the University.

Department of M[edicine and Surgery............418

Total,........................................  1,223.
The number of graduates was as follows: Mining Engineers 6; Civil Engineers 11; Bachelors of Science 5; Bachelors

is tle largest numiber that ever graduated in a single year.
DEPARTMTIIEXT OF SCIENCE, LITERIATURE AN'D THE A1RTS.
Comparing the above statistics with previous years we find
that the Department of Science, Literature and the Arts was
larger than ever before.  The number of students in this Departiment during the last ten years lias been as follows  1858,
301; 1859, 287; 1860, 282; 1861, 274; 1S62, 270; 1863, 266;
1864, 295; 1865, 279; 1866, 353; 1867, 335; 1868, 418. Thus
it will be seen that, with the natural slilght variations, tile Department is now steadily and rapidly increasing.  Indeed, it
has reached a magnitude as large as can well be accommoldated
without an increase in the number of Instructors.
Some changses have taken place in tile Faculty of this Department.. Dr. James. Boise, after nmore than fifteen lyears'
faithful service as Professor of the Greek Lanog-l age an-l Literature, has resigned his position. At his own recomlmendation,
my judgeneent entirely coinciding witlh is, one of our graduates
who has enjoyed his instructions, and who is entireiy compeltent
to maintain the high standard of this branch of study, Martin
L. D'Ooge, M. A., has beeen constituted Acting Professor of
Greek.
At the beginning of the year Rcev.,. 1). Chapin, M. A.
Professor of' Intellectlual and Moral Piliiosophy,v after four
years' faithful service, obtained leave of' absence to visit Europe, and has since resigned his place, tlie duties of his professorship being for the time assigned to tl1e President.  This
imposes upon ne so much a.dditional labor that I fear the gen

eral interests of the University may suffer somewhat for the
want of sufficient oversight and attention. Both of these gentlemen have assigned the smallness of their salary as one cause
of their departure, and it is only in regard to the necessity of
rigid economy that I have felt it proper to assum e the additional
labor imposed upon myself.
Charles K. Adams, M. A., Professor of History, has also
been in Europe during the entire year, without salary, but has
returned and will attend to tle duties of his professorship hereafter. Some changes in the course of study made it proper
for him to obtain leave of absence for one year, and I doubt
not that with the enlarged experience that he has acquired by
a study of the modes pursued in some of the best Universities
in Europe, he will be able greatly to increase the efficiency of
his professorship.
Allen J. Curtis, M. A., Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and
English Literature, has been absent the whole year on account
of poor health, and has since resigned his position. He is entitled to great credit for the ability, and assiduity, and success
with which he discharged his duties while whith us, and should
his health be restored and a vacancy arise in any professorship
suited to his taste, the University would do well, if possible,
to secure his services hereafter. In the mean time the profes.
sorship has been ably filled by the appointment of Moses Coit
Tyler, M. A., who by his zealous and able devotion to the L:glish Language and Literature, and the science and art of elocution, is greatly elevating the standard of scholarship of the
University in these branches of study.
It is not necessary for me to describe in particular the other
professorships in this Department. Suffice it to say, that all of
them seem to me to be making a commendable use of their
means to furnish the best possible facilities for a broad and
thorough culture.
The University has had, in this Department, a difficult problem to solve. Here it stands in the most vital and intimate
connection with the general school system  of the State.  It
professes to furnish to the gradilates of' tlle Higl) Schools of

the State opportunities to pursue their studies still farther.
Having no Preparatory Department of its own, the scale of
requirements for admission should be so adjusted as to encour*
age a proper scholarship in these High Schools. If the standard is put too low, it will tend to degrade the High Schools;
if too high, it will exclude the youth of the State who have a
claim to its benefits. The University has therefore aimed to.lay a foundation sufficiently broad to satisfy all just denands.
It has laid out the work of this Department in six parallel
courses of study, not taking any other college, American or
foreign, for its model, but endeavoring to meet the exact and
just demands of the School System of 3Michigan. I have examined this subject carefully, and fiom time to time presented
such recommendations as seemed to me to be needful, and to
the broad and liberal provisions made by the Board of Regents
is to be attributed greatly the present growing prosperity of
this Department. Notwithstanding the rivalry to which this
Department, in particular, is exposed, by the numerous colleges
in the country, old and young, its Classical Course and its various Scientific courses of study call in many students fiom all
parts of the State, and from other States and countries. Perhaps still more in this direction is needed. If that kind of industricus education which must, from the nature of the case,
be imperfectly given in the most of the so called Commercial
Colleges, is demanded, it would be wise to inquire whether it
could not be more systematically and thoroughly presented in
a large University than elsewhere. And if so, we should meet
the just demands of the people.
At the same time I have seen with regret a tendency, in some
of the cities of the West, to lower the standard of education
in thle High Schools, by excluding from the curriculum of studies the ancient languages and the higher mathematics usually
pursued there. This, I am constrained to say, arises from a
want of proper understanding of the subject on the part of
tlhose who recommend this degradation of the High Schools.
The object should be to broaden the base, so as to accommodate

system, can afford to furnish opportunities to its youth, of both
sexes, to study all of which they are capable.  There always
will be and should be a demand, on the part of those who desire the most extensive scholarship, to study the Latin and
Greek langu-ages. Those who desire to study theselanguages
and voluntarily choose them, will excel in them.
I am happy to add that, though the subject has been broached in some places in Michigan, so far as I know, the standard
of scholarship in the High Schools of the State has not in any
instance been lowered, Let Michigan be jealous of its reputation for attention to education. Large and expensive school
houses are arising in all our cities and villages as our population
and wealth increase. Let these High Schools be managed by
teachers competent to give a preparation for the University in
any of its courses of study, and also such additional advantages
as are obviously demanded.
DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY.
The number of Students in this Department was 107 less
than the year before. In so large a school the attendance will
fluctuate some from year to year, from causes not easily ascertained. I have an impression, from consulting severrl catalogues, that the whole number of Medical Students in t'-e
country was considerably less than the yearbefore, which may
have arisen fiomn the fact that, when the war closed, many who
had been in the army and whose professional studies had been
thus interrupted, availed themselves of the earliest opportunities to complete their education, while now matters have subsided into their normal condition. The number of graduates
this year was only two less than the year before.
The lectures and instructions were regularly given, and in
many respects the year may claim to have been extraordinarily
prosperous. Especially the clinical advantages of the School
were greater than usual, a very large number of patients presenting themselves for medical advice and surgical treatment,
before the class. The advantages of this Medical School in
this respect are regularly improving with the increase of population in Ann Arbor and vicinity.

Two of the Professors, Drs. S. G. Armor, and W. W.
Greene, resigned their positions at the close of the year, the
former having signified his intention so to do the preceding
year, and the latter, for a professorship in the Medical School
of Maine. Dr. H. F. Lyster, M. A., of Detroit, an alumnnus of
the University, has been elected t t the Chair of Surgery, and
due provision will be made to supply the other vacancy.
A large part of the collections in the Museum connected
with this Department was the private property of Dr. Ford,
but has been purchased by the University. There are still in
the Museum some specimens belonging to private parties, a
part of which it may be well to purchase, and provision should
be made for the systematic enlargement of the Museum.
Some other matters relating to this Department will be mentioned in a later part of this Report.
DEPA-RTMENT OF LAW.
TLe number of Students in the Department of Law was only
eight less than the year before, and considerably above any preceding year. The number of graduates was six more than the
preceding year.
The steady prosperity of this, the youngest Department of
the University, is very gratifying. The Law Library is regularly increasing, and the classes are nearly as large as can be
accommodated. It would add much to our convenience if we
had a separate building for the General Library, so that all of
the building erected for the Department of Law could be devoted to its accommlodation.
At the close of the year Prof. Ashley Pond, M. A., resigned
his professorship, and Charles A. Kent, M. A., was appointed
in his place.
FINANCIAL WANTS OF TIHE UNIVEIRSITY.
In previous reports I have shown the financial wants of the
University so fully and specifically that it would seem unnecessary to recapitulate this matter. I can only add that, with
the lapse of time, these wants unsupplied become the more

pressing. We need new buildings, and the old buildings want
repairs. The grounds should be newly fenced and properly
laid out. We ought to have a gymnasium. Other universities
are springing up around us, fostered by the liberal care of other
States. We must gradually recede from our high rank, unless
with the growth  of Michigan some additional pecuniary
strength is given to its State University.
Again would I express my high appreciation of the interest
in this subject manifested by the Legislature of 1867, and
though the University has not been able yet to avail itself of
the provision conditionally offered in the Act to aid the University of Michigan, approved by the Governor March 15, 1867,
still it would be improper not to acknowledge the solicitude
for the adequate support of the University manifested by both
branches of the Legislature.
RELATIVE TO A PROFESSOI- OF HO3IEOPATHY.
The duty imposed upon the President to embody in his report "such suggestions and recommendations as he may deem
best for the management and improvement of the University,"
seems to make it incumbent on me to express my views on the
present relations c.f the University to the State, as effected by
the legislature, relating to instruction in Homeopathy. In so
doing I shall not consult the wishes or opinions of any party
inside or outside of the University, but as plainly as I can, set
forth what appears to me to be the demand of sound science,
and the highest gcod of the University.
It is well known that so long ago as 1855, alaw was enacted
by the State "that there shall always be at least one Professor
of Homeopathy in the University of a ichioan." It is known
also that the Board of Eegents, from that time to the present
year, notwithstanding the numnerous changes in its membership,
had never appointed a Professor with this title. The Legislature of 1867 granted further aid to the University on condition
that this law should be executed. Your Honorable Body, after
much deliberation, determined to appoint a "Professor of Homeopathy," with instructions to lecture in a Homeopathic School,

to be regarded as a part of the University, but to be located
in some other town than Ann Arbor, provided that such a
school could be supported by the aid that should be furnished
it out of the before'-mentioned grant, and the voluntary con.
tributions of its friends. It was believed that this would be a
compliance with the law, and prevent any unhappy conflicts in
the Medical School at Ann Arbor. The Supreme Court of the
State has decided that this was not a compliance with the
law, and therefore the money granted to aid the University has
not been paid over, but still remains in the Treasury of the
State, and all the action of our Body on the subject is null
and void.
It becomes now a question of pressing interest, whether the
University should comply with the law and thus secure the
grant, or whether it should set forth clearly the reasons for
non-compliance with the law, and trust to the wisdom and justice of the State to mrake the grant unencumbered with conditions, and to repeal the old and unexecuted law requiring the
appointment of a " Professor of Homeopathy."
I wish here to state my unabated confidence in the disposition of the State, as represented in its Legislature, to deal
fairly and liberally with the University. I doubt not that the
law originally was passed with a purpose to do justice. I doubt
not that the Legislature of 1867 generally wished to strengthen
the University; and I think it was more honorable to the Legislature, and more promising to the future good of the University, to pass the act granting aid with that condition, than not
to have tendered aid on any condition. I am thankful that
the Legislature, after learning the facts, did not decide positively to refuse aid. I hope no Legislature will take that position, and I believe if good reasons can be presented why the
condition should not be complied with, the State will still
grant us assistance.
I believe, furthermore, that good reasons do exist why a
" Professor of Homeopathy,"' should not be appointed, and I
believe that all unprejudiced persons will be able to see them.
I beg here explicitly to state that I do not argue in behalf of

the Medical Profession, or "Allopathy," or any particular class.
I am not conscious of any particular interest in any class or
party, on this subject. So far as I am personally concerned,
it might be more politic to say nothing on the subject, but as a
custodian of the interests of the University, I must express
what the interests of sound education seem to me to require,
irrespective of party, or sect.
Observe then, first, that we have no Professor of "Allopathy"
in the University of Michigan. This is no subterfuge, but a
solemn fact. If a grant of money was offered to the University on condition that a Professor of Allopathy should be appointed, Ishould be compelled to show the unreasonableness
of the condition. We do not want in a University professors
of special ideas or theories, who believe'tthat their special ideas
or theories embrace all truth in their respective schools, and
that all outside of their special ideas or theories is false and to
be rooted up and condemned. You make the University, by
such a course, a place of strife and discord, and not'a place for
the harmonious inculcation of all truth.  What we want in
the Department of Medicine and Surgery, is a number of Professors who shall present all the subjects and all the in formation
properly belonging to the science and art cf Medicine and
Surgery. They should be, as they are, Professors of Anatomy,
Ph/ysiology, Pathology, PSurgery, Diseases in General, Diseases
of particular classes, Chemistry, llcateria lieedica, &amp;c., &amp;c.embracing the whole orb of the science and art of Medicine
and Surgery,-but not Professors of "Allopathy," " Homeopathy," "Hydropathy," or any other special theory; and the
graduates should receive, not a title-" Homeopathic Doctor,"
or " Allopathic Doctor," or " Hydropathic Doctor," or Doctor of any particular kind, but simply the old, time-honored
M. D.-Doctor of Medicine.
rT'lhis is no sublimated, unapproachable theory, but the only
proper basis of a University. The University does not establish a Department of Medicine and Surgery in the interests of
any particular class of physicians, or in the interest of conflicting classes of physicians, or with the special purpose of making

doctors of any particular kind, or of all kinds, but to teach the
science fully and broadly-not in conflicting schools and debates, but, as far'as possible, thoroughly-without reference to
local interests and partisan distinctions.  Once establish the
precedent that every party in the world shall be recognized by
name, and have a Professor bearing its pcartiscan name, and irreparable injury is done to the University.
But it may be said that, as a matter of fact, on the present
system, all the Professors are " Allopathic Doctors," and thus
Homeopathy is indirectly opposed.  Of this I can only say
that the theory which I advocate requires that the Regents,
in the appointments of Professors, should, according to their
own judgement, select the best men they can secure for the
professorships, untrammeled by the dictation of any bodies or
parties of men outside of the University, and having no regard
to the conflicts among professionalmen. In the selection of Professors in the Department of Science, Literature and the Arts,
or any other Department, they are to regard as little as they
choose the divisions on religious opinions which exist in society;
in the Department of Law, the differences of opinion on political theories; and in the Department of Medicine, the differences of opinion that prevail among well educated physicians.
If there are inherent difficulties here they are to be met boldly
and prudently. on a basis which can be defended, but I am
persuaded that the least defensible and most perilous way to
meet them is to elect men to Professorships, the very name of
which instructs them to be partisan defenders of exclusive theories;-as, for instance, in the Literary Department, Professors
of " Protestantism" or " Presbyterianism;" or in the Law Department, Professors of " Conservatism" or " ladicalism," or
"Democracy;" or in the Medical Department, Professors of
"Allopathy" or "Homeopathy."
It is not my business to describe Homeopathy, or Allopathy,
or any theory of the healing art, though the relation of this subject to the University has led me, impartially as I could, to
examine their claims. Homeopathists profess to cure by the
administration of medicine on one theory only, to wit: that

diseases must be overcome by medicines that willproduce disorder in a healthy body similar to that which they will heal in
a diseased body. They also usually conjoin with this a theory
that very small quantities of medicine, in many instances even
infinitesimal quantities-too small for the human mind clearly
to estimate, are efficient.
The regular school of physicians, called Allopathists by
Homeopathists, though they do not accept the name, and deny
that it is applicable, teach that all diseases and remedies are to
be studied experimentally, and that whatever medicines are
proved to be curative and beneficial should be employed, and
in doses of any size that may be found, by actual use, to be
necessary, whether large or small.
Strictly speaking, then, as an outsider, I cannot see why the
regular school of medicine, in theory, at least, does not embrace Homeopathy, so far as they, by actual use, find it beneficial. Their theory certainly requires that they should administer medicines on the Homedpathic systemn, and in infinitesimal
quantities, if they find, by study and practice, that medicines
so administered will heal disease. But their theory also requires that they should not confine themselves to any exclusive
method, if they find any other method more beneficial, but
always keep their eyes open to observe new facts and learn
new laws.
Nothing but inexcusable prejudice and a want of candor.
should prevent regular physicians from investigating IHomeopathy, and every other limited theory of cure, thoroughly; but
they are, by their professed basis of action, forbidden to shut
out light firom any other source. They profess to embrace the
whole orb of science and art, so far as it applies to the maintenance and recovery of physical and mental health.
Whatever may be the character of some doctors-human
nature being weak and perverted-ought not a University to
aim to teach science thus fully and impartially? Is it necessary to promote truth by the perpetual antagonisms of men who
believe that all who differ fiom them are not only incomplete,
but radically and essentially wrong? For my part, though not

a physician, I admire the theory of medical science, and clearly
see that its advocates have a foundation to build upon, as impregnable and eternal as truth. The Regents, who are elected
by the people, and are brought near to the interests of the
University, and are charged by the Constitution of the State
with its government, have never yet elected professional partisans to a place in the Faculty. I am sure the Legislature will
not ask them to do so if they consider the subject carefully.
For these reasons I hope that the State will not always insist,
as a condition of aid, that the teachers of any exclusive theory
shall be employed by the Regents of the University. And I
trust that your honorable body will neither select nor reject
candidates for professors in the interest of any outside party or
association, but, according to your best judgement, select liberal and well qualified men, each to give i:tstruction in some
natural division of the great territory of human knowledge and
power. At the same time I allow that the Regents ought to
respect the will of the people, and must in the end accept the
aid tendered by the State on the conditions insisted upon.
ADMISSION OF WOMIEN TO THE UNIVERSITY.
There is still another subject of vital interest to the cause of
education in the State, and connected with the University, and
that is the evident propriety that equal and impartial privileges
should be furnished by the State to botl sexes. The Legislature of 1867 adopted the following resolution:
' Resolved, That it is the deliberate opinion of this Legislature that the high objects for which the University of Michigan
was organized, will never be fully attained, until women are
admitted to all its rights and privileges."'
If this is the deliberate opinion of the Legislature it lmay be
supposed to be the opinion of a majority of the people of the
State, and if so, the University, belonging to the State, should
regard that opinion. A year ago, in my report, I briefly noticed this subject, and set forth the objections to the demand
made, as forcibly as I could, and recommended that no change
at that time be made in the policy of the University.  I ad

mitted, however, that young women ought to have all advantages for education furnished to young men, but deprecated the
agitation and perhaps temporary injury to the University that
might ensue, especially unless proper provision was made,
which would involve the expenditure of considerable money.
I advert to the subject again because I believe the State will
not be able to pass it by without investigation and action, and
because the State ought not to neglect it. It is not right that
girls and boys, young men and young women, should be educated together in our public schools, our high schools, and
our Normal School, and that the privileges of University education should be confined to only half of the population. If
young women wish to enjoy the advantages of our libraries,
and museums, and laboratories, and lectures, and other instruction, it is simply wrong to deny them the privilege.
If there are difficulties in the way, these questions should be
honestly investigated. Are these difficulties, or are they not
insuperable? If they can be properly guarded against, would
the expense of doing so be greater or less than to duplicate the
University, so as to give equal advantages to women elsewhere?
The more I consider the subject, and the more carefully I
study the results of the education of both sexes in the same
schools, the more inclined am I to the belief that the best
method for Michigan would be to make provision for the instruction of women at the University, on the same conditions
as men.
I have come to this conclusion slowly.  A few objections
have sometimes seemed to me strong, but the most of what is
urged against it is fanciful, and partakes of the nature of the
thoughtless opposition made to what is new. The standard of
education would not be changed. The habits of study would
not be affected. The honor of the University would be rather
increased than diminished. It does not injure the young men
at the Sorbonne in Paris that ladies also can listen to the lectures. The demand that women should enjoy the same advantages as men, grows out of Christian civilization, and if diffi

culties arise we must not shrink from them, but overcome them.
Responsibility makes strength.
I think, however, that to try this: ex2perimentfairly we should
make, as soon as convenient, some improvements in our buildings.  Some additional instructors also might be required.
Though the additional cost would be trifling compared with
that of establishing another college for women elsewhere, still
it would be more than could be met by the University out of
its present resources, unless the grant made by the State in
1867 could be received. In conclusion, I wish distinctly to be
understood that I do not desire obtrusively to interfere with
the educational provisions of the State, nor even to influence
unduly its action in regard to the University. It is my business
to execute, not to make the laws of the University.  I should
be content to superintend matters as they are here, or leave
that work for some other person. I have no doubt that as the
University has so largely increased in numbers, and in all the
indications of popularity within a few years, so it may continue
to enjoy public favor, if properly managed.  But any person
must be able to see that, while all things around us in this new
country are growing, the University can keep pace with the
State, and with the universities of other States, only by the
systematic increase of its income. Michigan has a population
of nearly a million; it will yet have several millions.  Shall
the University then have no more income than now?  How
then will it compare with the Universities of New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, and other States, that have not only tie proceeds of the public lands granted to them by the United States,
but also large additions to their resources from private munificence, and by grants of the respective States?
The fathers of Michigan did well, and the University has repaid their far-seeing enterprise in honor and usefulness —will
not the present generation imitate as well as eulogize their
fathers?

those departments of the Museum under my charge.
I. DEPARTMENT OF         GEOLOGY, ZOOLOGY         AND
BOTANY.
Everything has been accomplished in this department which
the limited resources at my command have permitted.  Some
very material assistance has been rendered by Mr. M. W. Harrington and Mr. J. B. Steere, members of the last senior class,
and now graduates- of the University. MIi. Harrington, in particular, devoted a considerable portion of ne.rly every week
to work in the laboratory or museum, and, though without any
compensation, rendered service which could not be dispensed
with. It gives me pleasure to say that Mr. Harrington, by authority of the Board of Regents, granted in September, 1867,
is now employed, at a moderate remuneration, to assist me in the
details of this department.

in providing a suitable location for the collections from Lake
Superior, to which reference was made in my last report; and
the re-arrangements became now, for the first time, possible,
by the construction, this year and last, of several new cases.
The want of these had long prevented me fiom giving the geological collections anything like a systematic distribution. Under the present arrangement the room attached to the Gallery
of Mineralogy is devoted exclusively to the Lithological sec;tion,
while the old library room is appropriated exclusively to the
Paleontological section. In the Lithological section there are
twenty-four cases assigned as follows:

3-4.      "           "     Iron.

Statement. The plan proposed cannot be completely carried into
execution until all the cases for this section are constructed. To
each case I have attached a description, in book form, of the geology of that age of the world illustrated in the case. These
several explant-otory volumes have been made by taking to pieces
a volume of Dana's Manual of Geology, and binding the parts
up sepatately. Each part is prefixed by a diagram of the Hall,
with the requisite explanations.
Some very important contributions to the geological cabinet
have been received from le Royale and the north shore cf
Lake Superior through Dr. A. E. Foote, Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory. Dr. Foote, with unusual, and extremely creditable zeal for science, organized, at his own risk, an extensive
expedition to the north shore of Lake Superior and the adjacent
islands. The expedition left in the latter part of April and
returned during September. The geological department of the
University furnished the party with a tent, a camp-chest and
utensils, and, in return for these facilities, as well as in recognition of the claims of his Alma Mater upon the services of
her Alumni, Dr. Foote has furnished my department with a
complete set of the geological, zoologicai and botanical specimens collected. These will be found more particularly enumerated below:
Additions to the Geological Ccbinet.
Du. A. E. FOOTE.   Twelve varieties of porphyry, mostly
from island St. IgTnace, mouth of Neepigon Bay, north shore of
Lake Superior.

In my Statement of 1866 I credited, through wrong inforiation, a remarkable specimen-the Double Crested Cormor:

FRENCH (Alumnus), of Homer, Calhoun Co.
I deem it but an act of justice to a gentleman of science who,
I am sure, would never ask the correction for his own sake, to
state that the entire collection of Insects obtained for the University some years since through the agency of Mr. R. Kennicott, and presented as a portion of the "Trowbridge Collection,"
should be credited to Mr. P. R. Uhler, of the Peabody Institute of Baltimore.  This information reached me indirectly
and without the agency of Mr. Uhler. It has been ascertained,
however, that these specimens were selected, labeled and pinned by Mr. UThler from his private collection as a donation
from himself directly to the University, and that he had no
knowledge that they were to be credited to the " Trowbridge
Collection."  It is claimed by Mr. Uhler's friends that this acknowledgement should be made.  In gladly rendering tardy
justice to a naturalist of so unpretending superiority, I desire

to state that 1. had 1no other agency in the transtatction reftrred
to than to receive the specimens as they purported to be-apart of the " Trowbridge Collection," with no particular mention of 1Mr. Uhler's name'
Lest this statement should seem1 to reflect upon the nmemory
of Mr. Kennicott, I ought to say further, that I be lieve, if this
zealous and conscientious young naturalist were living hle would
show that his honesty is not in the least implicated in this misunderstanding.
III. BOTANY.
Mr. Harrington lhas labeledt and placed oil exhibition the collection of seeds presented by Mr. Austin and myself, as also
the truncheons of wood presented by students of botany. IHe
lhas also completed the catalogue of the Houghton Herbarium,
fiom which it appears that this collection contains 612 species,
and about 2000 specimens. The Sager H-Ierbarium cataloglued
byDr.Lyons, isfoundto contain 878 species and 1 555 specimens.
Mr. Harrington has also looked throurgh the entire collection
of' duplicate plants and rectified the labeling according to the
modern nomenclature. The duplicate specimens number 4259,
land belong to 643 species. These have been llarranged, under
my direction, in ten labeled sets, of eachl of wllich a complete
catalogue has been made out. The sets are colposed as follows:
No. 1, 643 speecies; No. 2, 57S species; No. 3, 503 species;
No. 4, 440 species; No. 5, 372 species; No. 0, 310 species;
No. 7, 274 species; ~No. 8, 243 species; No. 9, 202 species;
No. 10, 19   ecie. 10, 1  ies  e are besides 307 specimlens of 108
species not included in the sets.
The foregoing plants are mostly in good condition and I
shall endeavor to use them in making exchanges for foreign
specimens. Nearly all were collected in the Lakae Superior
Iregion.

A Register for the names of visitors to the Museum was

of names registered to September 24th, 1868, is 3349.  It is
thought at least one-third of the visitors fail to register their
names. If so, the Museum has been visited by not less than
5000 persons during the last eleven months, which is at the rate
of 5400 per year. Of these, it is ascertained that 60 per cent.
are people of Michigan.

I have the pleasure to transmit for the consideration of the
Board of Regents the offer of Prof. James Orton, of Rochester
University, to place in our Museum a collection of 127.specimens of lavas from the Andes, for the moderate sum of $100.
These: specimens were collected by himself during the last year.
I would also respectfully urge the importance of completing
the cases in the Paleontological Hall, and constructing another
cabinet of drawers for specimens kept in the laboratory.
I should be pleased to see some steps taken toward the
founding of a Botanic Garden and Green House.  I believe,
after. considerable inquiry, and observation,.that much could be
done without permanent expense to the University.  Q0ice
founded, such an accessory to the University might be made
self-supporting, and would perhaps produce a small reyenue.
On this subject I would be pleased to confer with the Board
of Regents.

praying for the establishment of a Commercial Department in
the University.  On motion the petition was referred to the
Committee on the Scientific Course.
Regent Willard appeared and took his seat.
The President on behalf of the Executive Committee presented the following report:
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COIMMITTEE.
Since the last meeting of the Board two matters of importance required attention that could not safely be postponed.
Dr. P. B. Rose, Assistant in Chemistry, who has for several
years been employed in the Laboratory, and acquired great
familiarity and efficiency in the particular duties of his position,
resigned his place, his salary being but $500 a year, of which
$200 was paid firom the proceeds of the Laboratory. It would
be a great loss to the Laboratory to spare the services of Dr.
Rose, who has dispensed the chemicals to the students, keeping
the accounts, besides rendering other valuable services. The
Committee therefore agreed to promise Dr. Rose $500 a year
from the University, with the understanding thatDr. Douglass
should add $300 a year fiom the proceeds of the Laboratory..Also the well on the south side of the grounds was found to
be in a useless and perhaps dangerous condition. It had been
in use more than twenty years, and the stone foundation on
which the brick work rested had given away and caved in.
The Committee, after advising with several persons familiar
with such matters, ordered that it should be rebuilt from the
bottom, and put into good condition, the cost of which was
$446 29.
The Report was adopted, and on motion of Regent Walker
the appropriations asked for in the report were made by the
following vote:
Ayes —Regents Johnson, Walker, Willard, Gilbert and
Burt.
Regent Gilbert, Chairman of the Finance Committee, reported: That he had examined the accounts of receipts and
expenditures of the Laboratory, the Treasurer, and Secretary
and Steward, for the past year, and found them correct.
The Report was adopted.
Regent Gilbert, Chairman of the Finance Committee, read
the Annual Report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868.
Adopted and placed on file.

the Treasurer, is suedduring the year; also the Report of the
Treasurer marked B, showing the numbers and amounts of the
several warrants paid during the year, the items of receipts
and the sources from whence received. Placed on file.
An examination of the financial report will show that, with
an apparent balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July,
1868, of $12,000, more than that amount was required to pay
the warrants for salaries then due and appropriations previously made, exhausting the balance usually in reserve at the
expiration of the fiscal year, and leaving the treasury destitute.
With a nearly fixed income and constantly increasing expenses, this condition of the treasury is not unexpected, and
it becomes our duty to devise ways and means to meet the
deficit sure to occur at the end of the present year.
A careful review of the details of the expenditures of the
past year, and the wants of the present, suggests no opportunity for such a retrenchment as will afford material relief from
our present embarrassment. No one connected with the University is overpaid for service rendered, and many do not receive the compensation to which they may be considered fairly
entitled. The property of the University requires a large
annual expenditure for its preservation and insurance. The
libraries and various collections must have their annual contributions or become comparatively valueless, and the incidental
expenses of an institution affording instruction to more than
1,200 students must necessarily be large.

The income of the University cannot be increased from its
permanent fund, nor is it considered expedient to impose higher
charges for instruction.
Your committee cannot suggest any source froml which the
necessary aid can be derived, except the liberality of the State,
ard the friends of the University, and economies which it may
be possible to introduce into the general expenditure, which
latter would not materially affect the result.
The University will require at least $10,000 addition to its
estimated income for the present year, to enable it to maintain its
present position,and hereafter from $15,000 to $20,000 annually
in excess of its probable income from present sources, to enable
it to make such progress as will be expected of the leading University of the West.
As there is no prospect of immediate relief' from our anticipated embarrassment, the Finance Committee earnestly
desire that all applications for appropriations not included in
the estimates, be carefully considered, and especially do they
request that all expepditures may be confined to matters absolutely necessary to an efficient administration of the several
departments.

entire time of a Professor, and enable the Board to advance
his salary and make it equal to the pay of the Professors in
the Department of Science, Literature and the Arts, of equal
time of service in the University.
Respectfillly submitted,
A. SAGER, Dean.

Regent Stockwell, fiom the Commlittee on the Medical
Departlmel.t, to whom was referred the subject of Professors
giving private instruction to students, submitted the following
report, which was acceptedl
The Commnittee on the Medical Department would respectially repolt upon th-e subject of private fees. The Committee are firmly of the opinion that the practice alluded to is
manifestly productive of jealousy and ill-feeling among stulents, wxbhile its tendency is to treat slightingly in the general
class, Lmatters of lesser importance with a view to elaborate
them liore fuilly iin private.  In this way members of the general class, not niiembers of the private classes, would be deprived of the fill benefit of instruction that they would otherwise receive.
No man, howeveri exhalted his integrity, is proof against
nmore or less bias from interest. If from one, a fee, whether
greater or less is received, and firom another no such fee is
c.ontributed, it is but natural thllt the former is less liable to
that rigidc examinaition than the latter. If perfect justice is
accorded the latter, he will often feel himself agreived,

worked injury to the Institution, and, will hereafter in the judg

ment of the Committee. The principle filly adopted will also
prove productive of great abuse, and inter-faculty jealou iews.
In other Institutions a portion of the lecture hours otf each
Professor is occupied in a categorical review of subljects previously treated, which seems equal in value with the piroper lecture, benefitting all who are present. The tendency of' private
class teaching is to the abolition of this class of' instruction.
The Colmmittee would therefore recommlend the adoption

Ayes-Regents Johnson, Sill, Sweezey, Stockwell, Walker, Willard, Gilbert, and Burt.
Regent Gilbert presented the following report:
The Committee to w\honm was referred the s::bject of a
suitable method of heating the University buildings respectfully report,
That they have given the subject such consideration as
their limited time and facilities would afford, and recommend
that the Medical, Law, Museum and Laboratory buildings be
warned by steam. A new boiler is needed for the Laboratory, and your Committee think it would be practicable to
place in that building a boiler sufficiently large to warm both
it and the Medical building. We do not anticipate any difficulty in conducting the steam from one boiler through both
buildings. We estimate the cost of a boiler of 25 horse power,

a thorough piping of the Medical building, and the necessary
changes in the Laboratory at $4,000. Boiler now in the Laboratory might be used for the Law building, but it would be
insufficient for that and the Museum building. We recommend that it be sold and a new one obtained of sufficient capacity for both buildings. The cost of an outside boiler house,
boiler, and the necessary piping, we estimate at $4,000, after
deducting value of old boiler. Should we use the old boiler
and only undertake to warm the law building, the expense
would probably be about $2,300.
The report was adopted, and
Regent Johnson moved that the work be performed under
the direction of Regent Gilbert and Professor Douglass. The
expenses to be paid out of the State Aid Fund.
Adopted by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents   Johnson, Sill, Sweezey, Stockwell,
Walker, Willard, Gilbert, and Burt.
On motion of Regent Walker the Board went into Executive Session. After a short time spent therein, on motion of
Regent Walker, the Board adjourned, to meet Tuesday, June

Regent Walker, from the Committee to whom was referred the communication from Prof. Hempel, (see pages 384
and 339,) presented the following report, which was accepted:
To the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
The Committee appointed to inquire and report whether
Dr. Charles J. Hempel has a legal claim against the Board for
his salary, under his appointment as " Professor of the Theory
and Practice of Homceopathic Medicine in the the Michigan
School of Homeopathy" of March 25th, 1868, beg leave to
report:
We assume that the case of the People Ex. Rel. the Re

gents of the University vs. the Auditor General, has practically
determined two questions, viz:
First. That the Resolutions of March 25th, 1868, under
which tbc "Michigan School of Homceopathy" was authorized, and by which Dr. Hempel was appointed Professor
therein, were not in compliance with the provisions of the Law
of March 15th, 1867, inasmuch as that " School" was not to
be established at Ann Arbor, and the Professorship was not
"in the Department of Medicine of the University."
Second. That the Board of Regents have no authority
to establish a Department of, or a Professorship in, the University elsewhere than at Ann Arbor, without legislative
authority.
It is true that this last question was not directly passed
upon by a majority of the Supreme Court, but two members
of the Court expressed clear and decisive opinions upon that
subject, while one member was silent, and the fourth
dissented.
See Case 17 Mich. 170 and 188.
While that question has not therefore been definitely settled by a majority of the Court, we apprehend that the Board
of Regents would feel themselves bound to act upon the construction given to their powers by one-half of the Court being
a majority of the Judges who have expressed an opinion on
that subject.
Upon referring to the Resolutions already mentioned and
under which Dr. Hempel claims a salary, we find the Resolutions to be five in number.
The first accepts the aid proffered by the Act of 1867,
" with the terms and conditions thereof."
The second provides for an organization of the " Michigan
School of i omceopathy," at some other place than Ann Arbor,
in the State of Michigan, the location to depend upon contingencies therein named.
The third provides that two Professors be appointed "for
said School," one presently, and another at the opening
thereof.
The fourth appropriates $3,000, besides the salaries of the
Professors, in establishing said School, to be paid for by the
State tax provided for by the law of '67.
The fifth appoints Dr. Charles J. Hempel, Professor in this
" School," at a salary of $1,000, to be paid out of said fund.
It is entirely clear from these Resolutions, first: that the
School of HIommopathy was not to be established at Ann
Arbor, where the University is located, but elsewhere; and
that Dr. Hempel was appointed Professor, not in the University, bet in this School of Homoeopathy.
Now, it follows inevitably from the position, that the



</P>
<P><PB REF="00000346.tif" SEQ="00000346" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNSPEC" CNF="878" N="346" DISPLAYN="346" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?cc=umregproc;idno=acw7513.1864.001;debug=xml;c=umregproc;seq=346"/>
346
Board of Regents had no right to establish such a School out
of Ann Arbor, that they had no right to appoint a Professor
therein.
They were as powerless in the one case as in the other,
and their action was simply void.
It makes no difference that since that time and by the law
of '69, the State tax of 1867 has been placed at the disposal
of the Board without conditions.
The Board now unquestionably have a right to make appropriations out of that tax for the salaries of Professors.
The difficulty with the claim of Dr. Hempel lies back of that.
He is not a Professor in the University, and was not made so
by the very terms of his appointment.  He was made Professor "in the Michigan School of Homceopathy," a School that
the Board had no right to establish, and which does not in fact
or law exist.
The appointment was clearly in excess of their authority,
and the corporation are not bound thereby, or by the salary
which was proposed to be paid.
We are therefore of the opinion that Dr. Hempel has no
legal claim upon the Board of Regents.
That the question as to the future may be put at rest, we
respectfully recommend that a Resolution be passed revoking
any supposed appointment that may exist by virtue of the
Resolutions referred to.

In making out this summary for the Catalogue I was careful to include only those who have actually received instruction
here since the year 1868-9 begact. It is the custom in some
colleges, and heretofore was the custom here in the Literary
Department, to include the names of such as had graduated
into higher classes, and were entitled to be reckoned as members of those classes, even though absent fiom the University.
Had we included such names, as heretofore, the number would
have been increased about twenty or thirty. But I deem such
a reckoning not strictly honest.
The new students admitted to the Literary Department
during the last six years, were as follows: In 1863, 113; in
1864, 107; in 1865, 114; in 1866, 137; in 1867,129; in 1868,
156. The number of old students who returned has regularly
increased. The number of persons who have corresponded
with me during the past year with reference to corning to the
University has been very much larger than heretofore.
The Museum has been considerably enlarged, for the details of which I refer to the reports of the Curators. The collection belonging to Dr. Sager, has been purchased for $1,000,
and the excellent collection of fossils belonging to Dr. RorIinger, has been purchased for $1,500. The addition to the
Astronomical Observatory has been completed, furnishing a
convenient residence for the Director.
The great event of the year was a grant of aid by the
State, unencumbered with any objectionable conditions. The
grant made in 1867, of the promise of a tax of one-twentieth
of a mill on a dollar,. of the taxable property of the State,
amounting to a little more than $15,000 a year, was accompanied with the condition that the old law, which requires the
appointmnent of a Professor of Hornceopathy in the Department of Medicine should be carried out. 'he Regents endeavored to comply with the spirit of this law by offering to
establish a School of Homceopathy in some other place than
Ann Arbor, and to appropriate to its support a part of this
$15,000 a year, but the Supreme Court decided that such a
course would not be a fulfillment of the law.
Not wishing to lose this valuable grant, which had been
obtained by so much labor and against so great difficulties,
the Legislature of' 1869 were requested to remove the obnoxious condition. For the courtesy of the Legislature in inviting
me to deliver an address on the subject in the Hall of the
House of Representatives, and for the candid and full discussion of the subject in both Houses, I desire to record my expression of thanks. The result was an amendment of the law,
by which the University receives as aid $15,000 a year. This
is equivalent to an addition of more than $200,000 to its permanent fund. This is, so far as I know, one of the noblest
acts for higher education ever passed by the Legislature of an

American State. From this time forward the cause of the
University should be more rapidly onward and upward.
It may be proper also to state that the Supreme Court has
been requested by mandamus to require the Board of Regents
to execute the old law, " that there shall be at least one Professor of Homceopathy in the Department of MIedicine and
Surgery," but the Judges being equally divided in opinion upon
the constitutionality of the law, the mandamus was not granted.
Although but a small portion of the monley-thus secured
has been available during the year just closing, the University
has begun to feel the healthful influence of this action of the
State. Its friends are encouraged. Complaints of want of
appreciation by the State have ceased. Provision is made for
warming the Law Building, the Museum, and the Medical
Building, by steam. A plan is in preparation for a Gymnasium. A new fence around the grounds will soon be made.
A Hospital for the Medical Department is promised, and many
improvements are projected.
In closing my connection with the University I will not
make any recommendations with reference to its fiuture management. The care and wisdom of the Regents heretofore,
are a guarantee that it will be judiciously managed hereafter.
I hope that its broad and liberal basis will always be maintained. With the enlarged income now bestowed by the
State, it will be practicable to continue and increase the various
courses of study, while the Library, Museum and othor apparatus of instruction can be regularly improved.
I cannot take my departure from the University where I
have spent ten of the best years of my life, six as its President, without expressing my sincere thanks to the respective
Faculties and the Board of Regents for their unvarying kindness to me personally, and I deem it not ipl:roper to bear
testimony to iheir earnest labor for the best interests of the
University. The manly and moral and religious character of
the students has been especially gratifying, iand I trust that a
successful and brilliant future is before the University of AIichigan.

Ayes.-Regents Johnson, Sweezey, Walker, Willard, Gilbert, and Burt.
Regent Walker, on behalf of the Executive Committee,
reported adversely to the claims of Mr. J. II. Burleson for repairs made on the dwelling house lately occupied by him.
Report adopted.
The resignation of Dr. Wim. Warren Green, Professor of
Surgery, was received and accepted.
Regent Burt, Chairman of the C:nmmittee on the Museum,
stated that the Report of Prof. Winchell had been received,
and by request the Professor read the most inleresting parts
of his Report.
REPORT
Of Operations in the Milseltin of the Uiniveesity of Tichigacn,
in the Depamrtmenzt of 6' Geology, Zoology anzd jBotca-y,"
tand the Depajartment of " Archceology and Relics," for
the year e)ding September 21st, 1869.
No year in the history of the University has been marked
by a more rapid growth of the Museum, a greater amount of
work performed, or a greater interest in its centents, on the
part of the public.  Two large collections have been added,
the one by bequest, tlle other by purchase. Dr. George L.
Ames, late of Niles, a man of high standingl in his profession,
had attained a conspicuous position among tle naturalists of
the country.  He had devoted an immense amount of labor
to the collection and study of the plants and animalls of the
United States, when he was stricken down by valvular disease
of the heart. A portion of his collection of insects had been
placed in the Union School at Niles. The remainder, together
with his vast magazine of dried plants, was presented by Mrs.
Ames to the University. These specimens have been received;
and the plants have been thoroughly invoiced and arranged.
The total number of specimens of all kinds is about 22,500.
The details are given in their proper place.
David Van Vechten was a practical man, wlho went fiom
western New York to California and Nevada, where he spent

several years among the mines, and accumulated a large mass
of material, much of which was valuable, while some of the
specimens possessed unique interest. Returning, about three
years since, he deposited his collection in the University, with
a view to sale. He removed to Michigan, was taken sick and
recently died. The executors of his estate finally consented
to take $200 for the collection. It contains about 1000 entries
and 1788 specimens.
Other interesting additions will be specified in the sequel.
The rooms of the Museun  are daily thronged with visitors from all parts of the country. Though it is estimated
that not more than one-half of them register their names, the
following have been recorded during the year ending with
August last:-September, 314; October, 541; November, 376;
December, 304; January, 407; February, 446; March, 512;
April, 278; May, 317; June, 391; July, 299; August, 355.
Total, 4,540. It is probable there have been not less than ten
thousand individual visits to the Museum during the year.
The efficiency and usefulness of the AMuseum have been
greatly promoted by the assistance which has been fuirnished
in the multiplied details of its management. M. IM. Harringtor' s
services have been of immense value. His rewards pecuniarily,
have been so meagre that I feel it to be equally a duty and a
pleasure to testify to his knowledge, skill, fidelity, prudence
and patience in the performance of his work. Considerable
aid has been received from Messrs. J. B. Steere, A. B., E. L.
Mark, I.. W. Montose, H. C. Markham and S. T. Chamberlain, A. B. W. J. English, A. B. and E. L. Mark have acted
as janitors.

BOTANY.
I. GEOLOGY.
Eight cases, holding 192 drawers, have been constructed
for the accommodation of duplicates and specimens awaiting
investigation; and provision has been made for the completion of the series of exhibition cases in the Paleontological
Hall.
Some exchanges have been effected during the year with
the duplicates of the IMuseum. The usual number of presentations has been made. The University has purchased the
Van Vechten collection. The resumption of the State geological survey, under improved auspices, will result in a great
augmentation of authentic specimens fiom Michigan and con

tiguous regions. The University has very properly been made
the headquarters of the survey.
The investigations in geology and paleontology have made
some progress. In these I have been assisted by Mr. M. AW.
Ilarrington and Mr. T. C. Chamberlain. Among the more important results may be mentioned the determination of tle
existence of the " Marshall Group," in Tennessee, and in Venango County, Pennsylvania - a region which the highest
authorities had asserted to be occupied exclusively by the"Chemung."   Another interesting result is the discovery of abundant specimens of the peculiar genus Syringothyris throughout
the Marshall sandstones of Ohio and Pennsylvania. This genus was originally founded on specimens known only in our
Museum. These determinations have been based on collections submitted by Prof. James M. Safford of Tenncssee, and
Prof. E. 13. Andrews and Rev. I-. IHerzer of Ohio. The scientific interest and importance of these discoveries will be
understood by the geologist. They tend to settle, if they do
not completely settle, a great geological controversy.
Additions to the ilu(Sriseol in Geology.
THE VAN VE(CITTENC' COLLECTIOX.   - This was accumulated by David Van Vechten,     a amateur geologist, during a
residence of several years on the Pacific coast. It embraces
the usual classes of specimens from the mining distiicts, and
sone very interesting mammalian remains fiom Table Mountain, Cal., among which are teeth and bones of lacstocon;
tooth of an Elephant; skull and horns of lBos (latifronss2),
bones and teeth of a fossil IIorse, and fi'agments of the skull
and femur of man. These specimens acquire interest in connection with the questions relating tofossil man in California.

IT.  ZOOLOGY.
Arrangements have been made for the construction of a
new case in the south-west corner of the zoilogical gallery.
The entire collection of Birds has been rearranged and
relabelled, so that the visitor can now read both the scientific
and popular names of the species.  The labels are supported
by a new device which seens to be very effective.
The rearrangement and relabeling of the land and freshwater univalves has been completed; and the visitor can now
read distinctly the name of each species.  Many marine shells
and other specimens have for the first time been arranged and
placed on exiibition.  Among these are the last deposite of
shells from  the Smithsonian Institution; and the specimens
fiom the coast of Maine, received some years since from Dr.
J. DeLaski.   A collection of forty species, (400 specimens) of
duplicate shells-mostly marine-has been brought fioml the
attic, where they had lain since the life-time of Dr. Houghton,
and worked over and packed away.    The zoological specimens
of the Foote collection, 40 in number, so far as received, have
been worked up.*    The Cicadas have been investigated and
arranged; and the diurnal Lepidoptera further studied and
catalogued.
Mr. Harrington, assisted, to some extent, by T. C. Chamberlain, and Messrs. Mark, Markham    and Montrose, has collected the following fiesh specimens: Mammals, 14; Birds,
350; Reptiles, 15; Articulates, 1250; Molluscs, 350; total
1979 specimens.    Most of these have been identified and
labeled.
Mrs. S. E. Becraft, a lady of Ann Arbor, has been occupied nearly four months as taxidermist to the University, and
has given good satisfaction.   She is still on duty.  She has
been principally engaged in renewing the illustration of our
common species of birds and quadrupeds.      Something over
200 specimens of birds have been mounted, and numerous
skins preserved for exchanges. Mr. J. Hobson, the taxidermist of the Audubon Club, of Detroit, was employed to mount
a fine panther and a Boa constrictor.
* The Insects reported last year were subsequently taken by Dr. Foote,
and sent to Philadelphia for determination; since which none have been
returned.

* The numbers for Botany, in 1866, as given, are less than originally reported, in consequence of a former over-estimate of one of the collections.
t It will be borne in mind that these numbers do not set forth the magnitude of the entire Museum; since they do not embrace the cabinet of Mineralogy, nor the specimens (even in Zoology and comparative Osteology) in the
Museum of the Medical Department, nor the specimens ot the Art Collections.

DR. SAGER'S REPORTTo the Ilozonoable 3loa-rd f /Ile$lnts (f thec Uaiceersity of

GENTLEMrEN.-In conformity with a resolution )passed at
the last meeting of your Ilonorable 1Body, requiring the Medical Faculty to submit a report on the plan for the management of the Hospital, tile followin-g view3r in brief are respectfully submitted.
Assuming, that in establishing a Hospital in connection
with the Medical Department, your honorable body did not on
the one hand design to offer it as a p)ublic chllaity, nor on tlhe
other, intend rigidly to restrict its benefits to thiose who were
competent to meet the necessary chalrge for maintenance; believing, furthermore, that the main object of' a Hospital here
is, and should ever be, to utilize for practical inst:uction all the

clinical material that may present itself for medical and surgical treatment, tlhe Faculty beg to present the following plan
for carrying out these views:
1st. To realize to the fullest extent the benefits of this
Hospital it should be kept open for the reception and treatment of patients through the entire year. The Faculty are
aware that for a considerable period, if not indeed always, tle
winter class will greatly exceed in number those who remain
during the summer for Chemical and other instructions; yet
our experience justifies the kelief that when the Hospital shall
become a decided success, and other courses of practical instruction shall be inaugurated, a large class will be induce'd to
avail themselves of the advantages which will then be offered
to them, and which as a whole will hardly be surpassed by any
school in the country.
2d. No person shall be admitted into the wards of the
Iospital for treatment under the tnrms hereinafter mentioned,
except upon the condition of willingness to contribute, directly
or indirectly to the main object of the institution, in such
manner as the hospital staff shall direct.
The necessity for discrimination between patients who
may or may not with propriety be brought up before the class
will be obvious fiom a moment's consideraiton, and hence the
necessity for the aforesaid provision.
3rd. The general management of the Hospital shall be
under the control of the Medical Faculty, and the management of patients shall be under the control of the Hospital
Staff, consisting of the Professors of the Practical branches
in the University, and the distribution of the patients for
treatment shall be to the respective members of the Faculty
to whom the discussion of the diseases properly belongs.
Changes however, in this arrangement may be made
with the consent of the parties immediately affected by them.
4th. The immediate care of the wards for the general
purposes of hygiene, and of the house generally, as well as
the dietary of the patients, is made the duty of the Steward of
the Hospital, employed by the Faculty, under their immlediate
supervision.
5th. The general charge of the Commlissariat, em!lbraciln
the receipts and expenditures, will pertain to the Steward of
the University, who may avail himself of the aid of the Steward of the Hospital, as stipulated by the contract with the latter.
The Faculty would also respectfilly suggest, that the
charge for maintenance should be placed at the lowest rates
consistent with the avoidance of actual loss. On enquiry they
lhave found that four dollars per week is about the maximum
at present in our western Institutions. They submit that the

The experience of the past year has made it apparent
that without the aid granted by the State, the University
would have been in debt at the close of the last year. With
this aid and economy in expenditures it will be possible to
keep the University fiee fiom debt, and perhaps do something
towards the erection of much needed buildings for the use of
the University.
